       "  'abstract': 'Ubiquitous colloidal minerals such as goethite can have a significant impact on the performance of nanoparticles-based groundwater remediation due to aggregation. Heteroaggregation and retention of Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) by goethite in groundwater, and its impact on Hg remediation by SeNPs were investigated in this study. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of aggregation, the effects of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the stability of SeNPs and Hg sequestration using SeNPs were also evaluated. Heteroaggregation of SeNPs with goethite in groundwater was stronger than homoaggregation of SeNPs or goethite. Addition of EPS could slightly decrease homoaggregation of SeNPs and significantly reduce heteroaggregation. Column transport experiments showed that goethite coated quartz sand could retain 1.36 times a higher amount of SeNPs than uncoated quartz sand. Hg remediation by SeNPs was significantly inhibited by heteroaggregation of SeNPs with goethite and EPS could effectively mitigate this inhibitory effect. The Hg removal efficiency decreased to 71.6% and 66.9%, respectively in the presence of 20 and 100mgL goethite. When 200mgL EPS was added together with 100mgL goethite, 81.2% of the supplied Hg was removed from the groundwater. This study demonstrates that the widespread presence of goethite could significantly reduce the remediation efficiency of Hg contaminated groundwater and that EPS is a promising amendment for mitigating the adverse effects of heteroaggregation. This research also contributes to a further understanding of the environmental behaviour of nanoparticles.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Carbon nanotubes can be either toxic or beneficial to plant growth and can also modulate toxicity of organic contaminants through surface sorption. The complex interacting toxic effects of carbon nanotubes and organic contaminants in plants have received little attention in the literature to date. In this study, the toxicity of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT, 50 mg/L) and paraquat (MV, 0.82 mg/L), separately or in combination, were evaluated at the physiological and the proteomic level in Arabidopsis thaliana for 7-14 days. The results revealed that the exposure to MWCNT had no inhibitory effect on the growth of shoots and leaves. Rather, MWCNT stimulated the relative electron transport rate and the effective photochemical quantum yield of PSII value as compared to the control by around 12% and lateral root production up to nearly 4-fold as compared to the control. The protective effect of MWCNT on MV toxicity on the root surface area could be quantitatively explained by the extent of MV adsorption on MWCNT and was related to stimulation of photosynthesis, antioxidant protection and number and area of lateral roots which in turn helped nutrient assimilation. The influence of MWCNT and MV on photosynthesis and oxidative stress at the physiological level was consistent with the proteomics analysis, with various over-expressed photosynthesis-related proteins (by more than 2 folds) and various under-expressed oxidative stress related proteins (by about 2-3 folds). This study brings new insights into the interactive effects of two xenobiotics (MWCNT and MV) on the physiology of a model plant.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Glyphosate, one of the most popular herbicides, has become a prominent aquatic contaminant because of its huge usage. The eco-safety of glyphosate is still in controversy, and it is inconclusive how glyphosate influences aquatic microbial communities. In the present study, the effects of glyphosate on the structure and function of microbial communities in a freshwater microcosm were investigated. 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that glyphosate treatment (2.5\\xa0mg\\xa0L, 15 days) did not significantly alter the physical and chemical condition of the microcosm or the composition of the main species in the community, but metatranscriptomic analyses indicated that the transcriptions of some cyanobacteria were significantly influenced by glyphosate. The microbial community enhanced the gene expression in pathways related to translation, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism to potentially withstand glyphosate contamination. In the low phosphorus (P) environment, a common cyanobacterium, Synechococcus, plays a special role by utilizing glyphosate as P source and thus reducing its toxicity to other microbes, such as Pseudanabaena. In general, addition of glyphosate in our artificial microcosms did not strongly affect the aquatic microbial community composition but did alter the community's transcription levels, which might be potentially explained by that some microbes could alleviate glyphosate's toxicity by utilizing glyphosate as a P source.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study investigated the effects of glufosinate, a widely used herbicide, on the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum through short-term toxicity tests at the physiological and gene transcriptional levels. Glufosinate (4 mg L(-1)) decreased the amount of pigments but increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels. As a glutamine synthetase (GS) inhibitor, glufosinate affected the transcripts and activities of key enzymes related to nitrogen assimilation. Transcript levels of GS and nitrate reductase (NR) in P. tricornutum decreased to only 57 and 26 % of the control. However, transcript levels of nitrate transporter (NRT) and the small subunit of glutamate synthase (GltD) were 1.79 and 1.76 times higher than that of the control. The activities of NRT, GS and GOGAT were consistent with gene expression except for NR, which was regulated mainly by post-translational modification. Furthermore, the results of electron microscopy showed that chloroplast structure was disrupted in response to glufosinate exposure. These results demonstrated that glufosinate first disturbed nitrogen metabolism and caused a ROS burst, which disrupted chloroplast ultrastructure. Ultimately, the growth of P. tricornutum was greatly inhibited by glufosinate.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Enzymatic preparation and functional properties of wheat gluten hydrolysates',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The water-insolublity of wheat gluten is one of the major limitations for its more extensive use in food processing. Wheat gluten was enzymatically hydrolyzed by several commercially available proteases (Pancreatin Trypsin 6.0S, Porcine pepsin, Pancreatin and Alcalase 2.4L) with protein recovery varying from 42.5 ± 0.7% to 81.3 ± 0.1%. The hydrolytic efficiency of these proteases on wheat gluten was also compared. Alcalase served best for the preparation of wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGHs). Thus, Alcalase-assisted hydrolysates of wheat gluten (AWGHs) with different degrees of hydrolysis (DH 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0%) were further assessed for their functionalities. All the AWGHs had excellent solubility (>60%) over a pH range of 2–12. The emulsifying and foaming properties of AWGH with relatively low DH (5.0%) were remarkably higher compared to the original gluten. However, extensive hydrolysis of gluten resulted in remarkable reduction in emulsifying and foaming properties. Keywords Wheat gluten Enzymatic hydrolysis Alcalase Functional property 1 Introduction Proteases can be used to prepare peptides with characteristics that are a function of hydrolyzed protein, enzyme used, and conditions of hydrolysis. The products are distinguished from the original protein mainly by their small molecular size. Moreover, cleavage is usually accompanied by important structural rearrangements that tend to expose to the aqueous phase some hydrophobic regions originally buried within the protein molecule ( Phillips & Beuchat, 1981 ). Peptides can therefore be very different from the parent proteins and may possess new nutritional, functional or biological properties. Enzymatic hydrolysates are thus used in food industry, parachemistry and pharmacy. Wheat gluten represents about 72% of wheat protein. It is essentially used to improve the properties of flour for bread-making and as an additive in the baking industry; however its uses are becoming more diversified, both inside and outside the food industries, with the expansion of wheat starch production ( Bietz & Lookhart, 1996; Lens, Mulder, & Kolster, 1999; Maningart, Demeritt, Chinnaswamy, & Bassi, 1999 ). Some studies have shown the possibility of using limited enzymatic proteolysis as a processing technology. Study of protease action on wheat gluten proteins has had three major objectives. The first was to relate the physicochemical properties of gluten proteins with their functional properties. In particular, a number of authors have tried to modify the solubility of the gluten fraction enzymatically ( Batey, 1985; Mimouni, Azanza, & Raymond, 1999 ). This property is primordial, since it governs the use of these protein components as stabilizers for foams or emulsions ( Linarès, Larré, Lemeste, & Popineau, 2000; Popineau, Huchet, Larré, & Bérot, 2002 ). The second objective was to search for peptides with biological activity, especially with respect to celiac disease (gluten intolerance) ( Huebner, Lieberman, Rubino, & Wall, 1984; Cornell & Mothes, 1995; Cornell, 1998; Suetsuna & Chen, 2002 ). The third objective was to obtain structural or genetic information by comparing the composition of peptide fractions from different proteins ( Bietz & Rothfus, 1970; Danno & Natake, 1980; Galili & Feldman, 1985; Masson, Tomé, & Popineau, 1986; Shewry et al., 1984b ). Because of the insoluble nature of wheat gluten and the complexity of their composition, enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat gluten must usually be studied in heterogeneous dispersed or paste systems, and the products of hydrolysis are difficult to isolate and to characterize. Different proteases have been tried, such as pepsin, trypsin, papain, bromelain, and subtilisin. Wheat gluten hydrolysis results in peptide mixtures with high solubilities and altered foaming and emulsifying characteristics, depending on the degree of hydrolysis. The present study was designed to examine the use of commercially available proteolytic enzymes for the preparation of wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGHs), to select a suitable protease for the preparation of WGHs with different degrees of hydrolysis and to investigate selected functionalities of the resultant products. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Wheat gluten was kindly supplied by Lotus Gourmet Powder Group Company (Henan, China). 2.2 Chemicals and reagents All chemicals and reagents used in this work were food-grade or reagent-grade. Alcalase 2.4L (EC 3.4.21.62, from B. licheniformis, 2.4 AU/g) and Pancreatin Trypsin Novo 6.0S (PTN 6.0S) (EC 3.4.21.4, from porcine pancreas, 1350 usp-u/mg)were donated by Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Porcine pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1, 3140 BP u/g) and Pancreatin (146 USP u/mg) were supplied by Deyang biochemical products company (Sichuan, China). 2.3 Proteolysis with different enzymes 2.3.1 Hydrolysis with pepsin Wheat gluten was dissolved as a 5% (w/v) solution in 100 mM HCl to make the final pH 2.0. Pepsin (0.1% in water) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. No significant change of the pH was found during the reaction. 2.3.2 Proteolysis with Alcalase, trypsin and pancreatin Wheat gluten was dissolved as a 5% (w/v) solution in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.5). The suspension was incubated for 30 min at optimum temperature (see Table 1 ), depending on the enzyme used, and continuously stirred. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme to give a final enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The reaction was continued for 6 h and the pH of the mixture was kept constant by continuously adding a 4 M NaOH solution to the reaction mixture. 2.3.3 Termination of the enzymatic reaction After the reaction period, the mixture was cooled, adjusted the pH to 7.0 with 0.5 M and 4 M NaOH and heating at 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C in a ZOPR-52D refrigerating centrifuge (Hitachi Koki Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant was freeze-dried and stored at −20 °C. 2.3.4 Preparation of Alcalase-assisted wheat gluten hydrolysates (AWGHs) with different degrees of hydrolysis When the Alcalase hydrolysis had reached the set degree of hydrolysis (5%, 10% or 15%), it was terminated by adjusting the pH and heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was freeze-dried. Samples were kept at −20 °C until needed for functional tests. 2.4 Degree of hydrolysis 2.4.1 pH-stat assay The degree of hydrolysis (DH%), defined as the percent ratio of the number of peptide bonds broken ( h ) to the total number of bonds per unit weight ( h tot ), in each case, was calculated from the amount of base consumed ( Adler-Nissen, 1986 ), as given below: DH % = h × 100 h tot = B × N b × 100 α × M p × h tot where B is base consumption in ml; N b is normality of the base; α is average degree of dissociation of the α-NH 2 groups; MP is mass of protein (N × 5.7) in g; h is the hydrolysis equivalents in meqv/g protein and h tot is total number of peptide bonds in the protein substrate (8.38 meqv/g gluten protein). 2.4.2 Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) assay For peptic hydrolysis, DH was determined by the ratio of the percentage of 10% TCA-soluble nitrogen to total nitrogen in the sample ( Drago & González, 2001 ). Aliquots were removed at the final time required and mixed with 20% TCA to create 10% TCA-soluble and TCA-insoluble fractions. After 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 g and the supernatants were analysed for nitrogen by the semimicro-Kjeldahl method ( AOAC, 1990 ). The degree of hydrolysis was calculated as follows: DH % = 10% TCA-soluble N in hydrolysate - 10 % TCA-soluble N in sample without hydrolysis total N of dispersion × 100 2.5 Determination of protein recovery of WGHs from wheat gluten Protein recovery was calculated as the amount of protein (%N × 5.7) present in the hydrolysates relative to the initial amount of protein present in the reaction mixture. This is an important measurement because a maximum recovery is desired in the production of hydrolyzed food proteins. 2.6 Functional properties of AWGHs 2.6.1 Solubility The modified nitrogen solubility index (NSI) procedure of Morr et al. (1985) was used to measure the solubility of gluten and AWGH samples at a pH range of 2–12. The solubility of the hydrolysate was expressed as the fraction of soluble N to total N. 2.6.2 Emulsifying capacity and stability The emulsifying activity of gluten and AWGHs was determined by the turbidimetric method of Pearce and Kinsella (1978) , with minor modifications. To prepare the emulsions, 9 ml of soybean oil and 21 ml of 0.2% protein solution (pH 7.0) were shaken together and homogenized in blender at 12,000 g for 1 min at 20 °C. Emulsion (50 μl) was taken from the bottom of the container after different time intervals (0 and 30 min) and diluted with 5 ml of 0.1% SDS solution. The absorbance of diluted emulsions was then determined at 500 nm and indicated as a turbidity. Emulsifying activity was determined from the absorbance measured immediately after emulsion formation. The emulsion stability was expressed as the difference value of the absorbance between 0 and 30 min. 2.6.3 Foaming capacity and stability Foaming capacity was evaluated by the method of Bernardi Don, Pilosof, and Bartholomai (1991) , with minor modifications. A 50 ml quantity of 1.0% protein solution was mixed thoroughly using an homogenizer at 10,000 g for 1 min in a 250 ml graduated cylinder. Foaming capacity (FC) was calculated as the percent increase in volume of the protein dispersion upon mixing. Foaming stability (FS) was estimated as the percent of foam remaining after 60 min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat gluten The control of enzymatic hydrolysis was related to the mechanism of proteolytic reactions involving a soluble enzyme and an insoluble substrate (wheat gluten). The hydrolysis of wheat gluten with Alcalase, Trypsin and Pancreatin proceeded at a rapid rate during the initial 30 min and then slowed down thereafter ( Fig. 1 ). This was typical for hydrolysis curves published for fish protein and whey protein ( Kristinsson & Rasco, 2000a; Mutilangi, Panyam, & Kilara, 1995 ). DH values varied from 0% to 15.8% after 360 min of incubation, depending upon the enzymes used. Alcalase gave the highest DH values and was more efficient for gluten hydrolysis than the others. For peptic hydrolysis of wheat gluten, DH was determined by the TCA assay. The hydrolytic curve ( Fig. 2 ) was similar to Fig. 1 , with DH values varied from 0% to 27.2% during 24 h of incubation. The correlation between the results of the two determination methods of degree of hydrolysis in wheat gluten hydrolysis with Alcalase is shown in Fig. 3 . The results obtained by the TCA assay were highly correlated with those obtained by the pH-stat assay (correlation coefficient of 0.9843), suggesting that the peptides formed during the initial stages of hydrolysis served as the substrate for the formation of smaller peptides, soluble in TCA. This was in agreement with the results reported by Netto and Galeazzi (1998) , who evaluated the hydrolysis of soy protein isolates by the two assays and obtained a good correlation between them. For the gluten hydrolysis with Alcalase, the DH varied from 0% to 16.0% and 0% to 63.7% determined, respectively, by pH-stat and TCA assays. This indicated that the hydrolytic efficiency of Alcalase was much higher than that of pepsin. 3.2 Protein recovery of WGHs from wheat gluten The yields of protein hydrolysates with different proteolytic enzymes are given in Table 2 . Although many factors affected the hydrolysis yield, the type of enzyme used had the greatest effect on the yield and properties of the final product. High protein recovery by Alcalase and its low cost may provide an incentive for using it in commercial operations. Thus, functional properties of protein hydrolysates so prepared (AWGHs) were further evaluated in order to determine their suitability in different industrial and/or food applications. 3.3 Functionalities of wheat gluten hydrolysates with Alcalase (AWGHs) 3.3.1 Solubility An increase in the extent of enzymatic hydrolysis corresponded to a considerable increase in the nitrogen solubility over the pH range studied, thus indicating a positive relationship ( Fig. 4 ). It has been suggested that an increase in the solubility of protein hydrolysates over that of the original protein is due to the reduction of its secondary structure and also to the enzymatic release of smaller polypeptide units from the protein ( Adler-Nissen, 1986; Chobert, Bertrand-Harb, & Nicolas, 1988 ). All AWGHs presented a similar pattern of NSI values, which could be due to the fact that the specificity of the enzyme used was the same in all these cases. With the increase of DH, the NSI values of the hydrolysates were gradually increased. The solubilities of AWGHs were pH-independent over the studied range. Such behavior was explained by the fact that smaller, more hydrophilic and more solvated polypeptide units were produced as a consequence of enzymatic hydrolysis; hence, aggregates were no longer formed, even at the isoelectric pH. 3.3.2 Emulsifying capacity and stability The emulsifying capacities of the hydrolysates were first increased and then decreased with increasing protein hydrolysis, as seen in Fig. 5 . The higher EC value (0.64) obtained for the sample of DH 5% can be attributed to the low level of degradation of wheat gluten molecules by Alcalase. This increased the availability of large peptide units at the oil–water interface, resulting in larger surface area and, consequently, greater emulsion formation ( Puski, 1975 ). With the increase of gluten hydrolysis, the extensive degradation of gluten resulted in the decrease of emulsifying capacity. The trend was similar to that reported in emulsifying properties of salmon muscle protein hydrolysates by Kristinsson and Rasco (2000b) . 3.3.3 Foaming capacity and stability Proteins in dispersions cause a lowering of the surface tension at the water–air interface, thus creating foaming capacity ( Surowka & Fik, 1992 ). Fig. 6 showed a significant increase in the foaming capacity for the DH 5% sample (158% volume increase) compared to the control sample (84.0% increase). This result suggested an increase in surface activity, probably due to the initially greater number of polypeptide chains that arose from partial proteolysis, which allowed more air to be incorporated. An improvement in foaming capacity for enzymatically modified food proteins was reported by Adler-Nissen (1986) . The decrease in foaming of the more extensively hydrolyzed samples, DH 10.0 (115%) and DH 15.0 (90%), suggested an opposite effect on the surface activity, probably due to the lower surfactant activity of smaller polypeptide chains from extensive hydrolysis. The most stable foam was obtained with the DH 5% sample, sustaining 40.0% of the initial foam after the 60 min quiescent period, far beyond the stability of the control sample, which sustained only 9.09% ( Fig. 7 ). Also, the foam stability decreased as the extent of hydrolysis increased. It has been suggested that stable protein foams were obtained from some larger protein components and partially hydrolyzed protein. More extensive hydrolysis increases the number of polypeptide chains which do not have the ability to stabilize the air cells of the foam. 4 Conclusion Compared with digestive enzymes (trypsin, pepsin and pancreatin), Alcalase-assisted hydrolysates of wheat gluten had a high protein recovery (81.3 ± 0.1%). The solubilities of all AWGHs were high at all DH over a wide pH range. And the emulsifying and foaming properties of AWGH with relatively low DH (5.0%) were remarkably higher compared to the original gluten. With the increasing of DH over 5%, the improved solubility did not translate into an improvement of interfacial properties, probably because the peptides generated were too small to stabilize the air/water and oil/water interfaces.

       "  'abstract': 'A rare drought occurred from 1998 to 2002 across much of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude regions. Using observational data and numerical models, we analyze the impact of this event on terrestrial ecosystem and the global carbon cycle. The biological productivity in these regions was found to decrease by 0.9 PgC yr−1 or 5% compared to the average of the previous two decades, in conjunction with significantly reduced vegetation greenness. The drought led to a land carbon release that is large enough to significantly modify the canonical tropically dominated ENSO response. An atmospheric inversion reveals that during the 1998–2002 drought period, Northern Hemisphere midlatitude changed from a 1980–1998 average of 0.7 PgC yr−1 carbon sink to nearly neutral to the atmosphere, while a forward model suggests a change of 1.3 PgC yr−1 in the same direction. This large CO2 source may explain the consecutive large increase in atmospheric CO2 growth rate of about 2 ppmv yr−1 in recent years, as well as the anomalous timing of events. This Northern Hemisphere CO2 anomaly was largely caused by reduced vegetation growth due to less precipitation, but also with significant contribution from higher temperature that directly increases respiration loss and indirectly further reduces soil moisture. Since the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude landscape has been significantly modified by agriculture, grazing, irrigation and fire suppression, the strong signature in the global carbon cycle of a drought initiated by changes in tropical oceanic temperatures is a remarkable manifestation of climate variability, with implications for carbon cycle response and feedback to future climate change.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MiGao, prepared from rice flour and sticky rice flour, is a kind of steam cooked Chinese cake. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of different additives (carboxylmethyl cellulose [CMC], xanthan, β-amylase and α-amylase) on the MiGao quality during storage for 0, 1, 3 and 5 days at room temperature (25C). MiGao texture was determined by measure the hardness of MiGao crumb during storage. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to follow changes of starch retrogradation in MiGao crumb. Among the preparations supplemented with additives as determined by texture and DSC measurements, followed the order of β-amylase > CMC > xanthan. In general, except when α-amylase was used, the overall acceptability of MiGao was always improved by the addition of additives. The simultaneous analysis of the firming and starch retrogradation results revealed that the anti-staling effect of additives might be due to the retardation in the starch retrogradation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.',\n",

One approach is Dual-Supply Voltage (DSV).DSV is to apply a lower supply voltage on selected non-critical gates for power saving while maintaining chip performance at the same time. In order to facilitate the power design in DSV, the same voltage gates are grouped to form islands. [21] presents a flow to generate and place voltage islands. However, after relocating gates to voltage islands, the original placement is changed and the timing might become worse. In this paper, we propose algorithms to redistribute gates for performance improvement. At the same time, all the DSV island/gate constraints are satisfied.

       "  'abstract': 'Microbiological, chemical and sensory changes in MiGao (a traditional Chinese steamed cake) were studied during five days of storage at 25 °C. Microorganisms examined for were: Enterobactericeae, lactic acid bacteria, Gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus strains, yeasts and moulds, and pH and moisture content were also analyzed. Total plate counts in the products under study in the third day of storage were in the range <10 3 CFU/g and the shelf-life of the product was estimated to be only two or three days by the panelists. During the first two days, Gram-positive bacteria were dominant, mainly represented by Staphylococcus epidermidis . Bacillus strains occurred by the third day, reaching a maximum level of 1 × 10 6 CFU/g after five days of storage. No Enterobactericeae or Lactic acid bacteria were detected in the processed products throughout the storage period. All the isolated strains from the mannitol salt agar belonged to the genus Staphylococcus . The predominant species were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Most Bacillus strains, isolated from the tryptone soya agar, belonged to the species Bacillus brevis . The count of yeasts and moulds increased slowly but remained low throughout the storage period. Keywords MiGao Microbiology Staphylococcus Bacillus 1 Introduction A small segment of the world population suffers from celiac disease. The responsible pathogenic factor has been traced to the gliadin fraction of gluten. The only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a strict adherence to a gluten free diet throughout the patient’s lifetime, which, in time, results in clinical and mucosal recovery ( Gallagher, Gormley, & Arendt, 2004 ). Rice has properties such as the absence of gluten, low levels of sodium, protein, fat and fibre, and a high amount of easily digested carbohydrates, which are desirable for certain special diets. Rice is one of the leading food crops in South East Asia including China, and the production of rice in this part of the world is much higher than that of wheat. It can be ground into powder and utilized to produce many kinds of foods, including several types of cake. Sticky rice has properties genetically different from the non-sticky variety, such as its lack of amylose in the starch and with abundant amylopectin starch. MiGao is one of the most widespread of these types of cake ( Fig. 1 ). This kind of cake is a steam cooked traditional Chinese food prepared from rice powder and sticky rice powder (in the ratio of 1:3) by steaming in a bamboo steamer ( Fig. 2 ). It is famous for its soft and sticky texture and is usually served as a dessert. With abundant nutrients, water activity of 0.92, and almost neutral pH of 6.7, MiGao can be considered a good medium for microbial growth. Microbial spoilage is the major problem causing deterioration of products but there is also a problem with physiological spoilage such as enzymic spoilage. The bacterial numbers were over 10 3 CFU/g, even if bacteria were not detected (<10 CFU/g) in the initial product analysis. Post-process contamination from the atmosphere or from surfaces during the steaming, finishing and wrapping procedures is unavoidable. Many workers have examined different aspects of MiGao production. Particular attention has been given to the various aspects such as process variations and preservation, and nutritional improvement ( Fu, Feng, & Lin, 2003; Peng & Luo, 2004 ). Nowadays, producers of MiGao are interested in extending the shelf life of this product in order to increase the potential market and satisfy consumer demands. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the different categories of the microorganisms in MiGao and discuss their interactions, to identify and characterize the desirable groups (Bacilli and cocci), in order to select the most suitable strains, according to their technological properties and antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, as starter or protective cultures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of the MiGao and sampling schedule Rice flour and sticky rice flour were obtained from the local market. MiGao was made from 180 g sticky rice flour; 120 g rice flour and 60 g sucrose. Ingredients were mixed with water and shaped by a mold, and then steamed in a bamboo steamer for 15–20 min. After cooling for 10 min the Migao samples packaged in polyethylene bags. These trials were repeated three times during the duration of the study. MiGao have a thickness of approximately 1.5 cm and diameter of 60 cm 2 . Freshly steamed MiGao are soft, pliable and elastic. 2.2 Storage and sampling After cooling, the processed product was stored at 25 °C, for up to five days and temperatures monitored on a daily basis throughout the storage period. The microbiological quality of raw materials was determined on the day of receipt and a microbiological analysis and sensory evaluation carried out on the processed product on the day of production and at daily intervals during the storage period. 2.3 Microbiological analysis On each sampling day, three packages were analysed. A 10 g portion of minced sample was aseptically weighed into 90 ml of physiological saline (0.85% NaCl) in a sterile plastic bag and blended in a stomacher for 2 min. After 30 min at room temperature, serial decimal dilutions in linger solution were prepared and 1 or 0.1 ml samples of appropriate dilutions were poured or spread on non-selective and selective agar plates. Total plate counts were determined on plate count agar pour plates and enumerated after an incubation period of 48–72 h at 30 °C. The number of Enterobacteriaceae was determined using a pour plate method on Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar at 37 °C for 24 h. Lactic acid bacteria were inoculated into de Man–Rogosa–Sharpe agar at 30 °C for five days. Populations of Gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci were determined by surface plating samples on mannitol salt agar followed by incubation at 30 °C for 72 h, Staphylococcus aureus was determined by Baird-Parker agar incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Bacillus strains were inoculated into tryptone soya agar at 30 °C for 24 h. Yeasts and molds populations were determined by surface plating sample on potato dextrose agar at 30 °C for seven days. 2.4 Identification of strains On each sampling day, 30 and 15 isolates (10 and 5 for each of the three samples) were randomly selected by picking colonies respectively from MSA, BP and TSA plates of highest dilution showing growth. The 270 isolates obtained were purified three times on MSA, BP and TSA plates and characterized morphologically by phase contrast microscopy and examined for motility, and for Gram reaction and catalase activity by dropping a 3% H 2 O 2 solution directly onto each plate. For the presumptive cocci strains, tests were performed at 30 °C. The isolates were subjected to the following tests: sensitivity to novobiocin, production of ammonia from urea, coagulase production, β-galactosidase activity, oxidase reaction, nitrate reduction, acetoin formation ( Baird-Parker, 1979 ) and fermentation of the following sugars: maltose, mannitol, mannose, lactose, l -arabinose, sucrose, raffinose, cellobiose, trehalose and d -xylose according to Sharp (1979) . For the presumptive Bacillus strains, tests were performed at 30 °C. Bacillus strains were identified with the standard tests and classification schemes described by Balows, Truper, Dworkin, Harder, and Schleifer (1992) and Claus and Berkeley (1986) . The following characteristics were determined: morphology, anaerobic growth, utilization of citrate and propionate, hydrolysis of casein, production of acetoin, reduction of nitrate, formation of dihydroxyacetone, growth at 50 and 65 °C, growth at 7% NaCl, Voges–Proskauer (V–P) test, catalase activity, and fermentation of carbohydrates. 2.5 Chemical analysis Moisture content was determined by the AACC moisture procedure 44–15A (2000). The pH was determined using a pH meter (PHS-3C, Ruili Analysis Instrument Company, Shanghai, China). 2.6 Sensory analysis Sensory evaluation carried out on the product on the day of production and at daily intervals during the storage period. Ten panelists gave a score between 1 and 9 for tenderness, colour, texture, flavour and overall acceptability and a mean score was estimated for each product. 3 Results Table 1 shows the microbiological analysis of the different groups during storage at 25 °C for five days. Populations of microorganisms increased overtime. Total plate counts in the products under study in the third day of storage at 25 °C were in the range <10 3 CFU/g, all under the maximum 10 3 CFU/g specification in the PR China Department of Health and Chinese guidelines. The shelf life is determined by the total plate counts according to the PR China Department of Health and Chinese guidelines. Although the bacterial counts were initially <10 CFU/g, this increased to 6 × 10 6 CFU/g after five days of storage. Populations of cocci on MiGao increased quickly for the first three days of storage, reaching a maximum level of 7 × 10 4 CFU/g. Bacillus strains, which were in the minority at the beginning increased to 2 × 10 4 CFU/g during the four days and reached a maximum after five days of storage. The yeasts and moulds counts increased slowly but remained low throughout the storage period. No Enterobactericeae and Lactic acid bacteria were detected in the processed products throughout the storage period. The chemical results are presented in Table 2 . The pH was fairly stable during storage, slowly declining from 6.70 to 6.66. MiGao moisture decreased sharply with time. The freshly cooked MiGao contained about 39.5% moisture. However, during two days of storage the moisture dropped to 28.4%. With additional storage time the moisture continued to decrease, but at a slow rate. In the course of storage, the moisture migrates from the crumb toward the crust and evaporates from the surface of the product ( Piazza & Masi, 1995 ). The result of sensory analyses demonstrated that storage for two days did not modify the sensory characteristics of the standard. After two days the MiGao were became more hard in texture and taste scores were lower (results not shown). The more detailed taxonomic studies for the Gram-positive bacteria, identified according to Sharp (1979) and Claus and Berkeley (1986) showed that during storage, staphylococci were initially dominant bacterial ( Table 1 ). They were present throughout the storage period however, after three days of storage, a group of large Gram-positive bacilli became important, and eventually dominated the microflora. All of the 206 gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci strains isolated from MiGao belonged to the genus Staphylococcus ( Table 3 ). In accordance with the separation of staphylococci and Kocuria proposed by Schleifer and Kloos (1975) , the staphylococci strains were able to grow in the presence of novobiocin, were lysozyme resistant and lysostaphin sensitive. The staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to novobiocin, 80% were coagulase-negative, thus belonged to the S. epidermidis group, whilst 20% were coagulase-positive; all coagulase-positive stains produced acid from mannitol anaerobically, as only S. aureus does ( Kloos, 1990 ). After three days of storage, a group of large Gram-positive bacilli became important. For identification of the bacilli, 115 isolates from TSA plates were examined. Based on our tests, two groups were found ( Table 4 ), tentatively identified according to Claus and Berkeley (1986) . One of the bacilli strains produced acid from glucose, but not from xylose. All strains of this group grew at 50 °C but failed to grow in 7% NaCl, According to Balows et al. (1992) , they were tentatively identified as Bacillus brevies . The other strains produced acid from glucose, and the sporangium was not swollen. All strains of this group grew in 7% NaCl indicating that they belong to Bacillus subtilis. Claus and Berkeley (1986) . 4 Discussion The rate of microbial growth in MiGao was very rapid during the five days storage. Although the total viable counts were still increasing rapidly at five days, the product was completely spoiled after only three days of storage. The high water content and higher water activity values in MiGao may play an important role in controlling the growth of bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were dominant species during storage. During the first three days, Staphylococci were the dominant bacterial group. Occurrence of S. epidermidis at the beginning is not surprising, probably entering due to human manipulation during manufacturing of MiGao since they are the most prevalent species found on normal human skin and are isolated occasionally from the skin of domestic animals ( Schleifer, 1986 ). The bacilli strains eventually became the dominant microorganisms. The water activity, pH and temperature during storage may play important roles in spore germination and growth of vegetative cells of Bacillus spp ( Condon, Palop, Raso, & Sala, 1996; Quintavalla & Parolari, 1993 ). B. brevis and B. subtilis were found. It was not widely represented during the first two days of storage. The dominance of B. brevis and B. subtilis in MiGao could be explained by the higher resistance to heat. These aerobic, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacteria are incorporated into MiGao dough by flour contaminated with bacterial spores ( Pattison, Lindsay, & Vonholy, 2003 ). Spores that are not killed during steaming in a bamboo steamer subsequently germinate and grow. Studies of the thermal resistance of Bacillus strains indicated a need for controlling survival and growth of B. brevis and B. subtilis in MiGao. The usual recommended control procedures such as stringent temperature control during cooking and testing of raw materials ( Bailey & Von Holy, 1993 ) can reduce the initial spore counts in dough, but not prevent germination and growth in MiGao. Bacterial survival processing of foods depended on pH, a w and other micro-environmental factors ( Condon, Lopez, Oria, & Sala, 1989 ). The work described in this article aimed at detection of rope spoilage, performed directly with MiGao samples, allowed isolation of different strains of spoilage-causing bacteria. The potential hazard of the presence of Bacilli and cocci in food or food ingredients should not, therefore, be ignored. In addition, new formulations should be assessed individually, as an ingredient may alter the shelf life or safety aspect considerably. Aspects that require further investigation include the formulation of products for improved microbial safety during storage (e.g. combined pH, temperature and natural preservatives).

However, the formative mechanisms of its eating quality and structural changes of rice during cooking have seldom been evaluated. In this study, sectional real-time cooking was performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic viscoelasticity analysis to monitor the phase transitions and mechanical changes of kernels, which exhibited different characteristics in different stages. Both glass transition and pasting behavior were captured, and showed more viscoelasticity of cooked rice at higher soaking temperatures. Meanwhile, the enzyme activity of rice during soaking was successfully measured by a rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA). Along with the differences of morphologies and crystalline structure at different soaking conditions, the findings of DSC and rheometer were further verified. This study provides effective methods to evaluate changes in rice during cooking and explains the mechanism of differences formed by the soaking temperature.',\n",

Although our knowledge of herbicides toxicity mechanisms at the physiological and molecular level in plant vegetative phase has increased substantially in the last decades, few studies have addressed the herbicide toxicity problematic on plant reproduction. Here, we determined the long-term (4-8 weeks) effect of a chiral herbicide, imazethapyr (IM), which has been increasingly used in plant crops, on floral organ development and reproduction in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. More specifically, we followed the effect of two IM enantiomers (R- and S-IM) on floral organ structure, seed production, pollen viability and the transcription of key genes involved in anther and pollen development. The results showed that IM strongly inhibited the transcripts of genes regulating A. thaliana tapetum development (DYT1: DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM 1), tapetal differentiation and function (TDF1: TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION1), and pollen wall formation and developments (AMS: ABORTED MICROSPORES, MYB103: MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 103, MS1: MALE STERILITY 1, MS2: MALE STERILITY 2). Since DYT1 positively regulates 33 genes involved in cell-wall modification (such as, TDF1, AMS, MYB103, MS1, MS2) that can catalyze the breakdown of polysaccharides to facilitate anther dehiscence, the consistent decrease in the transcription of these genes after IM exposure should hamper anther opening as observed under scanning electron microscopy. The toxicity of IM on anther opening further lead to a decrease in pollen production and pollen viability. Furthermore, long-term IM exposure increased the number of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP sites) in the DNA of A. thaliana and also altered the DNA of A. thaliana offspring grown in IM-free soils. Toxicity of IM on floral organs development and reproduction was generally higher in the presence of the R-IM enantiomer than of the S-IM enantiomer. This study unraveled several IM toxicity targets and mechanisms at the molecular and structural level linked to the toxicity of IM trace concentrations on A. thaliana reproduction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The widely used solvent extractant, tributyl phosphate (TBP), primarily used as a solvent for the conventional processing of nuclear fuel, has come under scrutiny recently due to concerns surrounding potential environmental contamination and toxicity. In this study, we found that, in Phaeodactylum tricornutum, administration of TBP severely inhibited algal cell growth by reducing photosynthetic efficiency and inducing oxidative stress. We further explored the effect of TBP by examining the gene expression of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and its contribution to reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Our data revealed that TBP affected both fatty acid content and profile by regulating the transcription of genes related to glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and β-oxidation. These results demonstrated that TBP did in fact trigger the synthesis of ROS, disrupting the subcellular membrane structure of this aquatic organism. Our study brings new insight into the fundamental mechanism of toxicity exerted by TBP on the marine alga P. tricornutum.',\n",

Exposure to 0.5 and 1.5μM Cu or 1.0 and 2.0μM Cd alone significantly decreased algal growth and chlorophyll content and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. Two-way ANOVA analysis shows that the combination of these two metal compounds decreased cell growth, chlorophyll content and increased ROS content synergistically. The highest algal cell inhibition was 78.55%, the lowest levels of chl a, chl b and total-chl were 10.59%, 33.33% and 17.94% of the control, respectively. The highest increase in ROS was 9.15-fold greater than that of the control when exposed to Cu(1.5)+Cd(2.0). Real-time PCR shows that Cu and Cd reduced the transcript abundance of psbA and rbcL, but without a synergistic interaction, whereas Cu and Cd increased the transcript abundance of psaB synergistically. These results demonstrate that Cu and Cd independently inhibit PSII activity and CO2 assimilation, but synergistically increase ROS content to disrupt chlorophyll synthesis and inhibit cell growth.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cereal Chem. 83(1):69-75 The main by-product of the wheat germ oil extraction process is a defatted wheat germ meal, which has a relatively high protein content, making it an attractive and promising source of vegetable proteins. Four protein fractions (albumin, globulin, prolamine, and glutelin) and protein isolate from defatted wheat germ flour (DWGF) were fractionated and then characterized by amino acid analysis, SDS-PAGE, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Albumin was the major fraction (34.5%) extracted, followed by globulin (15.6%), glutelin (10.6%), and prolamine (4.6%). Protein isolate was mainly composed of albumin and globulin. These protein fractions and protein isolate showed an excellent balance of all essential amino acids, with a relatively high level of glutamic acid, arginine, leucine, and glycine, whereas cystine was lacking. All the esti- mated nutritional quality parameters based on amino acids composition showed that defatted wheat germ proteins had good nutritional quality. Nonreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE analyses showed that S-S bonds were deficient in the structure of wheat germ proteins. The albumin fraction consisted of 19 major polypeptide bands with Mr 14,000-84,000. The globulin fraction showed four distinct polypeptides or polypeptide group bands with Mr 55,000, 37,000-43,000, 24,000, and 12,000-20,000, which may be the components of the 8S-type and 11S-like proteins. The prolamine fraction showed a predominant doublet-like band at Mr 17,000-16,000, while the glutelin fraction showed five major polypeptide bands with Mr 39,000, 20,000, 18,000, 17,000, and 14,000. Protein isolate and DWGF showed very similar SDS-PAGE patterns. Except for prola- mine and glutelin fractions without detectable calorimetric response, the globulin fraction possessed the highest thermal stability (Td = 83.80°C, ΔH =1.36 J/g ), followed by protein isolate (Td = 80.05°C, ΔH = 0.76 J/g), while the albumin fraction was lowest (Td = 69.72°C, ΔH = 0.53 J/g). The findings on defatted wheat germ proteins are important for their potential application as functional food ingredients.',\n",

Here, we evaluated the toxicity of LEV and OTC to cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae monocultures and freshwater microcosms. Three test cyanobacteria were inhibited by both LEV and OTC at all examined concentrations. The growth of the eukaryotic organisms C. vulgaris and Monoraphidium sp. was only inhibited by high concentrations of OTC ranging from 1000 to 10,000\\xa0μg/L; however, they were less sensitive to LEV and OTC than cyanobacteria. In the aquatic microcosms, 5\\xa0μg/L of LEV and OTC did not affect the alpha diversity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities or the composition of the eukaryotic microbial communities after 14 d of exposure. However, this concentration of LEV and OTC significantly changed the prokaryotic microbial community structure at the genus level, and different antibiotics affected the prokaryotic microbial community differently, suggesting that different antibiotics affect prokaryotes through different molecular mechanisms, thereby leading to differences in prokaryotic microbial growth patterns. Moreover, the changes in the prokaryotic microbial community composition suggested that low antibiotic concentrations in water could disturb prokaryotic microbial communities and cause ecological risks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Accurate and efficient thermal analysis for a VLSI chip is crucial, both for sign-off reliability verification and for design-time circuit optimization. To determine an accurate temperature profile, it is important to simulate a die together with its thermal mounts: this requires solving Poisson's equation on a non-rectangular 3D domain. This paper presents a class of eigendecomposition-based fast Poisson solvers (FPS) for chip-level thermal analysis. We start with a solver that solves a rectangular 3D domain with mixed boundary conditions in O(NlogN) time, where N is the dimension of the finite-difference matrix. Then we reveal, for the first time in the literature, a strong relation between fast Poisson solvers and Green-function-based methods. Finally, we propose an FPS method that leverages the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve non-rectangular 3D domains efficiently. We demonstrate that this approach solves a system of dimension 5.33e6 in only 11 Conjugate Gradient iterations, with a runtime of 171 seconds, a 6X speedup over the popular ICCG solver.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The plant rhizosphere microbiota plays multiple roles in plant growth. We investigated the taxonomic and functional variations in the rhizosphere microbial community, examining both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, of four crops at the seedling stage: wheat, barley and two rice varieties (indica and japonica) seeded in paddy soil. The diversity of rhizosphere communities in these four species were determined. Results showed that wheat and barley had much stronger selection effects than rice for the rhizosphere microbial community. Functional metagenomic proﬁling indicated that a series of sequences related to glycan, limonene and pinene degradation pathways, as well as some relatively rare functions related to N or S metabolism, were enriched in the rhizosphere soil. We conclude that the four tested crops induced the formation of microbial community with specific features which may influence the plant growth, but the stochastic processes also appreciably influenced the functional selection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is well known that imbalance state of glucose metabolism triggers many metabolic diseases and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle accounts for 90% of body weight. Geniposide is one of the major natural bioactive constituents of gardenia fruit, and the regulation of geniposide on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle has not been investigated yet. Here, based on microarray analysis, we discovered that geinposide decreased PDK4 expression in skeletal muscle of mice, and we subsequently found that geniposide inhibited the expressions of FoxO1, PDK4, P-PDH in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, geniposide promoted a switch of slow-to-fast myofiber type and glucose utilization, suggesting that geniposide improved glucose homeostasis. In addition, mechanistic studies revealed that geniposide played above roles by regulating FoxO1/PDK4, which controlled fuel selection via PDH. Meanwhile, effects of geniposide mentioned above could be reversed by FoxO1 overexpression. Together, these results establish that geniposide confers controls on fuel usage and glucose homeostasis through FoxO1/PDK4 in skeletal muscle.',\n",

This study examines the toxicity targets of Cu in the modeled marine diatom, , at the physiological (cell division, DNA cell cycle), biochemical [pigments synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA)], structural (subcellular observation by flow cytometry) and molecular (transcription of several metalloprotein genes) level. Cu toxicity was detectable at all these levels after 48\\xa0h of exposure to ≥20\\xa0μM total initial added Cu. The order of sensitivity of all the studied Cu toxicity endpoints was: G2/M phase\\xa0>\\xa0MDA\\xa0>\\xa0metalloproteins RNA of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC)\\xa0>\\xa0metalloproteins RNA of the respiratory chains\\xa0>\\xa0G0/G1 phase\\xa0>\\xa0pigments\\xa0≈\\xa0S phase\\xa0>\\xa0propidium iodide\\xa0>\\xa0estimated cell yield\\xa0>\\xa0ROS. The relatively sensitive decrease of the transcription of metalloproteins RNA of the ETC in response to Cu exposure, if associated to an effective decrease in the expression of the proteins composing the ETC, may help to initially mitigate the ROS-mediated toxic effects of Cu in . . However, this cellular response to Cu was only transitory and the transcription of virtually all genes involved in redox electron transfer chains was up-regulated within an interval of 2\\xa0days.

       "  'abstract': 'Because brominated flame retardants are being banned or phased out worldwide, organophosphate flame retardants have been used as alternatives on a large scale and have thus become ubiquitous environmental contaminants; this raises great concerns about their environmental health risk and toxicity. Considering that previous research has identified the nervous system as a sensitive target, Japanese medaka were used as an aquatic organism model to evaluate the developmental neurotoxicity of 4 organophosphate flame retardants: triphenyl phosphate, tri-n-butyl phosphate, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). The embryo toxicity test showed that organophosphate flame retardant exposure could decrease hatchability, delay time to hatching, increase the occurrence of malformations, reduce body length, and slow heart rate. Regarding locomotor behavior, exposure to the tested organophosphate flame retardants (except TCEP) for 96\\u2009h resulted in hypoactivity for medaka larvae in both the free-swimming and the dark-to-light photoperiod stimulation test. Changes of acetylcholinesterase activity and transcriptional responses of genes related to the nervous system likely provide a reasonable explanation for the neurobehavioral disruption. Overall, the present study clearly demonstrates the developmental neurotoxicity of various organophosphate flame retardants with very different potency and contribute to the determination of which organophosphate flame retardants are appropriate substitutes, as well as the consideration of whether regulations are reasonable and required.

Frying was carried out in intermittent mode (two batches each for 12 min without any time lag) and repeated for 600 frying cycles. Results indicated that the French fries that were fried in oils having lower heat transfer coefficients contained lower acrylamide concentrations (913 µg kg(-1)), whereas those fried with oils having higher heat transfer coefficients contained higher acrylamide concentrations (1219 µg kg(-1)). Unlike the peroxide value, acrylamide levels in French fries did not change significantly with an increase in the number of frying cycles when tested for 600 frying cycles for every type of oil. This study clearly indicates that the contribution of frying oils to the formation of acrylamide should not be neglected due to their different heat transfer coefficients. On the other hand, continuous use of frying oil does not lead to a higher acrylamide concentration in French fries.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials, but the mechanism of AgNP toxicity in terrestrial plants is still unclear. We compared the toxic effects of AgNPs and Ag+ on Arabidopsis thaliana at the physiological, ultrastructural and molecular levels. AgNPs did not affect seed germination; however, they showed stronger inhibitory effect on root elongation than Ag+. The results of transmission electron microscopy and metal content analysis showed that AgNPs could be accumulated in leaves. These absorbed AgNPs disrupted the thylakoid membrane structure and decreased chlorophyll content, which can inhibit plant growth. By comparison, a small amount of Ag+ was absorbed by seedlings, and it did not pronouncedly affect chloroplast structure and other metal ion absorption as AgNPs did. Compared with Ag+, AgNPs could alter the transcription of antioxidant and aquaporin genes, indicating that AgNPs changed the balance between the oxidant and antioxidant systems, and also affected the homeostasis of water and other small molecules within the plant body. All the data from physiological, ultrastructural and molecular levels suggest that AgNPs were more toxic than Ag+.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sharp increases in food production worldwide are attributable to agricultural intensification aided by heavy use of agrochemicals. This massive use of pesticides and fertilizers in combination with global climate change has led to collateral damage in freshwater systems, notably an increase in the frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs). The precise mechanisms and magnitude of effects that pesticides exert on HCBs formation and proliferation have received little research attention and are poorly constrained. We found that azoxystrobin (AZ), a common strobilurin fungicide, can favor cyanobacterial growth through growth inhibition of eukaryotic competitors (Chlorophyta) and possibly by inhibiting cyanobacterial parasites (fungi) as well as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Meta-transcriptomic analyses identified AZ-responsive genes and biochemical pathways in eukaryotic plankton and bacteria, potentially explaining the microbial effects of AZ. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the intertwined effects of a fungicide and eutrophication on microbial planktonic communities and cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic freshwater ecosystem. This knowledge may prove useful in mitigating cyanobacteria blooms resulting from agricultural intensification.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dramatic rises in the power consumption and integration density of contemporary systems-on-chip (SoCs) have led to the need for careful attention to chip-level thermal integrity. High temperatures or uneven temperature distribu- tions may result not only in reliability issues, but also timing failures, due to the temperature-dependent nature of chip time-to-failure and delay, respectively. To resolve these issues, high-quality, accurate thermal modeling and analysis, and thermally oriented placement optimizations, are essential prior to tapeout. This paper first presents an overview of thermal modeling and simulation methods, such as finite-difference time domain, finite element, model reduction, random walk, and Green-function based algorithms, that are appropriate for use in placement algorithms. Next, two-dimensional and three- dimensional thermal-aware placement algorithms such as matrix-synthesis, simulated annealing, partition-driven, and force directed are presented.

       "  'abstract': 'Growing concern over possible adverse effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has driven the development of associated screening methods. The use of the vitellogenin (VTG) induction response in cultured teleost hepatocytes has been suggested as an in vitro screening assay for EDCs. However, current data do not sufficiently support this assay in the routine screening of chemicals. This study established and validated the use of primary cultured hepatocytes from zebrafish to screen chemicals for anti-estrogenic activities. Here we measured the transcript levels of selected hepatic estrogen-response genes, including vtg1, vtg2 and eralpha. Two model anti-estrogens, letrozole (LET), an aromatase inhibitor, and tamoxifen (TAM), a competitive estrogen receptor, were selected as representative chemicals. Additionally, comparisons between in vitro and in vivo assays were performed. As expected, there were concentration-dependent decreases for all three genes in the liver of female zebrafish exposed to LET in vivo for 72h. Similar responses were observed in males. As for in vitro testing, no discernable alterations in the gene transcripts were found in hepatocytes from males or females. In the case of TAM, exposure for 72h caused transcriptional reduction of hepatic estrogen-response genes in females in vivo and in vitro. In males, low concentrations of TAM resulted in increased expression of genes, while the expression decreased slightly at higher concentrations. Since these observations were in agreement with the pharmaceutical properties of two tested chemicals, the primary hepatocyte culture could be a promising tool for screening suspected EDCs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'High-performance integrated circuits are now reaching the 100-plus watt regime, and power delivery and power grid signal integrity have become critical. Analyzing the performance of the power delivery system requires knowledge of the current drawn by the functional blocks that comprise a typical hierarchical design. However, current designs are of such complexity that it is difficult for a designer to determine what a realistic worst-case switching pattern for the various blocks would be in order to maximize noise at a specific location. This paper uses information about the power dissipation of a chip to derive an upper bound on the worst-case voltage drop at an early stage of design. An exact integer linear programming (ILP) method is first developed, followed by an effective heuristic to speed up the exact method. A circuit of 43 K nodes is analyzed within 70 s, and the worst-case scenarios found correlate well with the results from an ILP solver.',\n",

This advanced notion is more important in marine mobile computing since the oceangoing vessels are usually constrained with less storage and computation resources. In such a scenario, vessels always firstly outsource data set and perform a function computing over them or at first outsource computing functions and input data set into them. However, vessels may choose which delegation computation type to outsource, which generally depends on the actual circumstances. Hence, we propose a scalable verifiable outsourcing computation protocol () in marine cloud computing at first and extract a single-mode version of it (), where both protocols allow anyone who holds verification tokens to efficiently verify the computed result returned from cloud. In this way, the introduced “scalable” property lets vessels adjust the protocol to cope with different delegation situations in practice.

       "  'title': 'TEMPORARY REMOVAL: Effects of oxathiapiprolin on photosynthetic activity of Chlorella pyrenoidosa probed by chlorophyll fluorescence and thermoluminescence assays.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Oxathiapiprolin is the first member of the piperidinyl thiazole isoxazoline fungicides developed globally as DuPont™ Zorvec™ for the control of plant diseases caused by Oomycete pathogens. Although they have great application potential, ecotoxicological data, especially their non-target effects on photosynthesis of algae and higher plants are completely lacking. Effects of a novel oxathiapiprolin biocide on the photosynthesis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa were therefore investigated using chlorophyll a fluorescence and thermoluminescence techniques. Effects of the bioicide on photosynthetic electron transport and energy absorption and dissipation were concentration dependent. Inhibition of the electron donor side of PSII significantly increased as oxathiapiprolin concentration increased from 0 to 100 μM. The oxathiapiprolin treatment increased the effective antenna size per reaction center and the dissipated energy flux per reaction center. It damaged PSII reaction centers and blocked the electron transport flux, thus inhibiting photochemical activity in Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Exposure to oxathiapiprolin at concentrations up to 50 μM had little effect on QA− reoxidation kinetics on the electron acceptor side. Only a higher concentration (100 μM) of the oxathiapiprolin biocide exerted obvious inhibitory effects on QA− reoxidation. At 100 μM, electron transport beyond QA was drastically blocked, and more QA was reoxidized through S2(QAQB)− charge combination. As the concentration increased from 0 to 100 μM, the thermoluminescence C band decreased with increasing oxathiapiprolin concentration, whereas the intensity of the Q band increased which was associated with the decrease of B1 and B2 band intensity. This confirmed that the bioicide hindered electron transfer after QA and caused an increase of S2/S3QB− and TyrD+ QA− recombination. This study implies that when oxathiapiprolin biocides are applied to farmlands, they may pose a potential risk to algae and higher plants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Photosynthesis is a very important metabolic pathway for plant growth and crop yield. This report investigated the effect of the herbicide imazethapyr on photosynthesis in the Arabidopsis thaliana pnsB3 mutant (a defect in the NDH pathway) and pgr5 mutant (a defect in the PGR5 pathway) to determine which cyclic electron transport chain (CET) of the NDH and PGR5 pathways is more important for protecting the photosynthetic system under herbicide stress. The results showed that 20 μg/L imazethapyr markedly inhibited the growth of the three ecotypes of A. thaliana and produced more anthocyanins and reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly in the pgr5 mutant. The chlorophyll fluorescence results showed that PSII was severely damaged in the pgr5 mutant. Additionally, the CET was significantly stimulated to protect the photosynthetic system from light damage in Wt and the pnsB3 mutant but not the pgr5 mutant. The real-time PCR analysis indicated that imazethapyr treatment considerably decreased the transcript levels of most photosynthesis-related genes in the three treated groups. Several genes in the PGR5 pathway were significantly induced in the pnsB3 mutant, but no genes in the NDH pathway were induced in the pgr5 mutant. The gene transcription analysis showed that the pgr5 mutant cannot compensate for the deficit in the PGR5 pathway by stimulating the NDH pathway, whereas the pnsB3 mutant can compensate for the deficit in the CET cycle by regulating the PGR5 pathway. The iTRAQ analyses also showed that the photosynthesis system, glycolysis and TCA cycle suffered the most severe damage in the pgr5 mutant. All of these results showed that the PGR5 pathway is more critical for electron transfer around PSI than the NDH pathway to resist herbicide stress.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study investigated the effects of paraquat, a widely used herbicide, on the aquatic unicellular alga  through short-term toxicity tests at the physiological and gene transcriptional levels. Exposure to 0.5\\xa0μM paraquat increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase to levels 4.93, 3.19, and 3.09 times higher, respectively, than those of the control. Furthermore, exposure to 0.75\\xa0μM paraquat increased the activities of these antioxidant enzymes to even higher levels. The decrease in chlorophyll content and the increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde content following exposure to paraquat suggest that the alga was severely damaged and cell growth was greatly inhibited. Real-time PCR showed that paraquat reduced the transcript abundance of B and L to 7.09 and 29.83% of the control, respectively.

       "  'abstract': 'In electronic communication and wireless communication, message authentication should\\n         be necessary. However, traditional method message authentication code (MAC) employs\\n         a symmetric cryptographical technique and it needs to keep a shared private key between\\n         two parties. For convenience, people now begins to use public key techniques to provide\\n         message authentication. In wireless communication, we shall save more space for message\\n         itself because of the limited resources. Therefore, we believe that our proposed digital\\n         signature scheme will be more fitful for this kind of communication due to the following\\n         merits: (1) in addition to inheriting the merits of RSA signature such as high verification\\n         efficiency, the proposed scheme also shows its advantage over RSA by resisting low\\n         public key exponent attack; (2) comparing with 1024 bits RSA, our digital signature\\n         scheme can sign 2048‐bit long message once, and generate a signature with 1025 bits\\n         length which doubles the capacity of the 1024‐bit RSA signature; (3) the scheme is\\n         provably secure and its security is tightly related to the hardness of conic‐based\\n         (CB)‐RSA assumption.

       "  'abstract': 'Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have been used in a broad range of applications. However, they are inevitably released into the marine environment, making it necessary to evaluate their potential effects on marine phytoplankton. In this study, the short-term (96h) effects of CuNPs and CuSO4 on Phacodactylum tricornutum growth, photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species production and transcription were assessed. It was found that high concentrations (40μM) of CuNPs and CuSO4 significantly inhibited the growth, photosynthesis and induced oxidative stress of P. tricornutum, while lower concentrations caused a hormetic response as indicated by a slight stimulation in algal growth. The high percentage of dissolved Cu (78-100%) in culture medium suggested that the dissolved Cu was the main driver of toxicity during CuNPs treatment. The algal cells upregulated electron transport chain-related genes to produce more energy and restore photosynthesis after 96h of treatment with CuNPs and CuSO4. This study delineates the cellular mechanism behind the toxicity of CuNPs and CuSO4 on marine diatoms.',\n",

In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut microbiota. L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent inflammation activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut microbiota disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut microbiota was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota regulated by L-Arabinose.

       "  'abstract': 'Imazethapyr (IM) is a chiral herbicide with two enantiomers (R-IM and S-IM). Here, we determined the enantioselective effects of IM on Arabidopsis thaliana biomass and chlorophyll content, root exudates and rhizosphere microbes after 7\\xa0days of exposure. The results suggested that 133\\xa0μg/kg R-IM enantiomer in soil slightly inhibited plant biomass but S-IM did not exert significant inhibitory effects. The rhizosphere microorganism composition was also found to have enantiomeric differences between R- and S-IM. The relative abundance of beneficial rhizosphere microbes such as Bacillus and Ramlibacter increased much more with R-IM treatment than with S-IM treatment, indicating that the rhizosphere recruited some beneficial microbes to resist the herbicide stress. The IM enantiomers exerted a significant influence on root exudates with enantioselectivity. R-IM resulted in higher levels of most amino acids, organic acids, sugars and other metabolites after 7\\xa0days of exposure; few metabolites were increased by only the S-IM treatment. The correlation analyses between compounds (sugars, amino acids and organic acid) and microbes at the genus level revealed that the number of microbes was more positively correlated with organic acids than other compounds, indicating that organic acids can attract more microbes than amino acids and sugars. Some organic acids, such as 3-hydroxybutyric acid, may be a carbon source for the beneficial microbe Ramlibacter. This study increases the understanding of the differences in IM enantiomer toxicity with respect to plant physiological activity and soil microorganisms.',\n",

In this study we use the hyperspectral data collected by GOME-2 to characterize the difference due to SRF under various conditions.

       "  'abstract': 'Exchanging items over mobile ad hoc network has been considered a challenging issue in recent years. To tackle this challenge, Verifiably Encrypted Signature (VES), which is employed as primitives when designing a large class of protocols such as certified email, fair exchange, and contract signing in wireless communication, provides a possible solution. However, the limited communication band, low computational ability and weak energy power restrict many existing verifiably encrypted signatures to be applied in ad hoc networks directly. In this paper, we propose a compact verifiably encrypted signature scheme without random oracles based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem (CDH) with pairings. Comparing with prior works, our scheme achieves the following desired features: (1) Our verifiably encrypted signature has compact size (only two group elements) which is optimal for both Elgamal encryption and the Waters signature; (2) The scheme is more efficient in terms of signature generation and verification; (3) Our scheme also achieves provable security under a standard complexity assumption in the standard model. Apparently, our schemes are amongst the most efficient solutions in terms of both signature size and computation (optimal ) because these features are important in wireless communication due to limited bandwidth and power. It can be surely applied flexibly to many secure exchange circumstances in mobile ad hoc network that solely allows the minimum cryptographic implementation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"A digital signature scheme that achieves an optimal bandwidth (generating signatures as short as possible) is called an optimal signature scheme. The previous optimal signature schemes all need the random permutations (or the ideal ciphers) with large block size as building blocks. However, the practical cipher with large block size such as Halevi and Rogaway's CMC-mode should call the underlying secure block cipher with small block size many times each time. This makes the previous optimal signature schemes which use the large domain permutation (or the ideal cipher) less efficient in the real world, even if there exist the methods that can encipher the messages with larger domain. On the other hand, all the practical signature schemes are not optimal in bandwidth including PSS-R, FDH, DSA, etc. Hence, the problem on how to design a practical, efficient and optimal signature scheme remains open. This paper uses two random oracles and an ideal cipher with a smaller block size to design an optimal padding for signature schemes. The ideal cipher in our scheme can be implemented with a truly real block cipher (e.g. AES). Therefore, we provide a perfect solution to the open problem. More precisely, we design a practical, efficient and optimal signature scheme. Particularly, in the case of RSA, the padding leads the signature scheme to achieve not only optimality in bandwidth but also a tight security.\",\n",

The hardness of the MiGao increased during stored at 25 °C for 5 days. Rapid visco analyser (RVA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray were quantified to analysis the retrogradation behaviour of MiGao. The most significant change in the pasting curve was the increase in peak viscosity over time measured with an RVA. FT-IR indicated changes in crystallinity of the MiGao crumb. The X-ray diffraction patterns could be classified as typical of A-type starch for the fresh MiGao. With aging, the B type structure increases, while the A-type structure remains virtually unchanged.

In this study, the acute toxicity (96\\u202fh) of AZ at concentrations of 1.0\\u202fmg/L and 5.0\\u202fmg/L on the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum were examined. At the tested concentrations, AZ significantly inhibited P. tricornutum growth and destroyed its cellular structure. Furthermore, the mechanisms of AZ-induced toxicity on P. tricornutum changed as the exposure time extended. Forty-eight hours after exposure, AZ inhibited P. tricornutum growth primarily via inducing oxidative stress, which increased the activity of two main antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, and inhibited energy metabolism. However, after 96\\u202fh of treatment, the decline in the photosynthetic capacity of P. tricornutum demonstrated that the photosystem was the main AZ target. The pigment content and expression levels of genes related to photosynthetic electron transfer reactions were also significantly decreased. The present study describes AZ toxicity in P. tricornutum and is very valuable for assessing the environmental risk of AZ.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The behavior of the coupled carbon cycle and physical climate system in a global warming scenario is studied using an Earth system model including the atmosphere, land, ocean, and the carbon cycle embedded in these components. A fully coupled carbon-climate simulation and several sensitivity runs were conducted for the period of 1860–2100 with prescribed IPCC-SRES-A1B emission scenario. Results indicate a positive feedback to global warming from the interactive carbon cycle, with an additional increase of 90 ppmv in the atmospheric CO2, and 0.6 degree additional warming, thus confirming recent results from the Hadley Centre and IPSL. However, the changes in various carbon pools are more modest, largely due to the multiple limiting factors constraining terrestrial productivity and carbon loss. The large differences among the three models are manifestations of some of the poorly constrained processes such as the global strength of the CO2 fertilization effect and the turnover time and rates of soil decomposition.',\n",

In the present study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS), combined with histopathological analysis, was used to screen hepatic responses in adult male zebrafish. Eight proteins were found to be up-regulated more than 2-fold, whereas five protein spots were down-regulated more than 2-fold after 1nM E2 treatment for 14 days, which had caused histological effects in zebrafish livers. These differentially expressed proteins accounted for a variety of cellular biological processes, such as response to oxidative stress, cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction, oxidation-reduction and cellular calcium ion homeostasis. The results demonstrated that E2 comprehensively influenced a variety of cellular and biological processes in zebrafish. Moreover, the proteomic responses elicited in zebrafish allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)-induced toxicity fully.',\n",

However, it remains poorly understood how these airborne microorganisms vary and which factors influence the microbial distribution in different anthropogenic activity regions. To explore the regional differences of bacteria and fungi in airborne particles, PM and PM samples were collected in the urban and rural areas of Hangzhou. The bacterial and fungal communities in the urban atmosphere was more similar to each other than those in the rural atmosphere. Analyses conducted by the concentration weighted trajectory model demonstrated that the local environment contributed more to the similarity of airborne bacteria and fungi compared with the atmospheric transport. The concentrations of local air pollutants (PM, PM, NO, SO and CO) were positively correlated with the similarity of the bacterial and fungal communities. Additionally, the concentrations of these air pollutants in the urban site were about 1.5 times than those in the rural site. This implicated that anthropogenic activity, which is the essential cause of air pollutants, influenced the similarity of airborne bacteria and fungi in the urban area.

       "  'abstract': 'Optimal signatures (generating signatures as short as possible), which achieve the\\n         optimal bandwidth for communication, are extremely useful in bandwidth‐critical networks.\\n         Previous approaches use the random permutations with large block size as building\\n         blocks, which incurs less efficient implementations in the real world. Meanwhile,\\n         all the practical signature schemes are not optimal in bandwidth including PSS‐R (probabilistic\\n         signature scheme with message recovery ), FDH ( Full Domain Hash), and DSA (Digital\\n         Signature Algorithm). This paper presents three constructions for optimal signature\\n         schemes. All the proposals use both the random oracles and the ideal ciphers with\\n         smaller block sizes as building blocks to obtain optimal paddings for signature schemes.\\n         The ideal ciphers in our schemes can be implemented by real block ciphers (e.g., AES\\n         (Advanced Encryption Standard)‐256). Concrete implementations of these signature schemes\\n         can utilize the trapdoor permutations of Rabin and RSA, respectively. Surprisingly,\\n         RSA and Rabin (trapdoor permutations) lead to not only optimality in bandwidth but\\n         also a tight security. Therefore, besides yielding secure signatures with high efficiency,\\n         our proposals can also be flexibly applied to the bandwidth‐limited networks that\\n         reduces the communication cost as less as possible.

       "  'abstract': 'Atrazine (ATZ) is the most common pesticide of freshwater ecosystems in the world. The effects of ATZ exposure on the induction of oxidative stress and the alteration of gene expression were studied in liver and ovary samples from female zebrafish (Danio rerio). Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT), in addition to the GSH and MDA content, in the liver altered significantly; the mRNA levels for the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, such as Cu/Zn-Sod, Mn-Sod, Cat, and Gpx, were up-regulated significantly in the liver when zebrafish were exposed to various concentrations of ATZ for 14d. However, the mRNA induction patterns were not in accordance with those of antioxidant enzyme changes in the liver and ovary. Moreover, the transcriptional expression of mitochondrial inner membrane genes related to ROS production, such as Ucp-2 and Bcl-2, were altered significantly in high ATZ treatment groups. However, the ATZ treatment did not induce any apparent changes in the transcriptional expression of CoxI, Ndi, or ATPo6, which are related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to study the transcriptional effects of ATZ stress on zebrafish. The information presented in this study will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress induced by ATZ in fish.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'When the concentrations of ampicillin (Amp), atrazine (Atr) and cadmium chloride (Cd) reach excessive quantities, they become toxic to aquatic organisms. Due to the acceleration of the industrialization and the intensification of human activities, the incidence and concentrations of these types of pollutants in aquatic systems are increasing. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of Amp, Atr and Cd on the physiological indices and gene expression levels in Microcystis aeruginosa. These three pollutants significantly induced antioxidant activity but continuously accelerated the cellular oxidative damage in microalgae, which suggests an imbalance between the oxidant and the antioxidant systems. Amp, Atr and Cd also decreased the transcription of psaB, psbD1 and rbcL; the lowest transcription of these genes was only 38.1, 23.7 and 7% of the control, respectively. These three pollutants affected nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) uptake by inhibiting the transcription of N or P absorbing and transporting related genes, and they down regulated the transcription of microcystin-related genes, which caused a decrease of microcystin levels; and the lowest level of microcystin was only 42.4% of the control. Our results suggest that these pollutants may cause pleiotropic effects on algal growth and physiological and biochemical reactions, and they may even affect secondary metabolic processes.',\n",

In this study, the enantioselective effects of S- and racemic (Rac)-metolachlor on the oxidative stress of wheat seedlings was determined based on physiological and gene transcription differences. Growth inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of tested metolachlor, and S-metolachlor had a stronger inhibitory effect than did Rac-metolachlor. Root growth was also significantly inhibited, but no enantioselective effects from the tested concentrations of the metolachlor enantiomers were observed. At a concentration of 5\\xa0mg\\xa0L−1, the maximal fresh weight inhibition reached 63.7% and 53.8% for S-metolachlor and Rac-metolachlor, respectively. In response to the S-metolachlor treatment, the maximum level of superoxide anions and malondialdehyde (MDA) increased to 1.73 and 2.55 times that in response to the control treatment, both of which were greater than those in response to the Rac-metolachlor treatment. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) also increased in response to the S-metolachlor treatment, but the activity of peroxidase (POD) decreased. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that, compared with the Rac-metolachlor treatment, the S-metolachlor treatment attenuated the expression of several antioxidant genes.

       "  'abstract': 'Identity-based signcryption (IBSC) is a cryptographic primitive which combines both the functions of identity-based signature and identity-based encryption in a single logical step, but with the cost of computation and communication significantly less than those needed by the signature-then-encryption approach. The first proposal Yu etal. (2009). [12] for IBSC schemes without random oracles and its improvement Zhang (2010). [15] were found insecure. Recently Li and Takagi (2011). [16] presented an improved IBSC, but at the price of large signcryptext expansion and more exponentiation computation. In this paper we reconsider the first (but insecure) IBSC proposal, and find that a small modification will result in a secure IBSC. Unlike that of Li and Takagi, our scheme does not sacrifice the bandwidth and computation efficiency to achieve the security goals. We use the proof techniques of Li and Takagi to prove in the standard model its indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack. Through comparison of computational cost and communication overhead, our scheme is amongst the most efficient IBSC schemes without random oracles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.',\n",

To evaluate this issue in an environmentally relevant model, we assessed the developmental neurotoxicity induced by Microcystis aeruginosa on newly hatched zebrafish. After four days of exposure, the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae was significantly decreased with increasing algae concentration. The levels of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and dopamine (DA) were decreased, accompanied by a decline in ache, chrna7 and manf and a compensatory increase in nr4a2b transcription. Furthermore, the expression of nine marker genes for nervous system function or development, namely, elavl3, gap43, gfap, mbp, nestin, ngn1, nkx2.2a, shha and syn2a, similarly decreased after algal exposure. These results demonstrated that Microcystis aeruginosa exposure affected cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, the transcription of key nervous system genes, and consequently the activity level of larval zebrafish. Importantly, discrepancies in the neurotoxic effects observed in this study and in previous reports that were based on exposure to pure cyanotoxin highlight the necessity for further investigation of cyanobacterial bloom mixtures when assessing the ecotoxicity of cyanobacteria.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'WeChat, both a location-based social network (LBSN) and an online social network (OSN), is an immensely popular application in China. In this paper we specifically focus on a popular WeChat sub-service, namely, the People Nearby service, which is exemplary of a find-and-flirt service, similar to those on Momo and Tinder. Specifically, the People Nearby service reads in the current geographic location of the device to locate a list of other people using WeChat who are in the same vicinity. The user can then request to establish a WeChat friendship relation with any of the users on the list. In this paper, we explore: (i) if one gender tends to use the People Nearby service more than another; (ii) if users of People Nearby are more anonymous than ordinary WeChat users; (iii) if ordinary WeChat users are more anonymous than Twitter users. We also take an in-depth examination of the user anonymity and demographics in a combined fashion and examine: (iv) if ordinary WeChat females are more anonymous than ordinary males; (v) if People Nearby females are more anonymous than People Nearby males. By answering these questions, we will gain significant insights into modern online dating and friendship creation, insights that should be able to inform sociologists as well as designers of future find-and-flirt services.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Multisignatures extend standard digital signatures to allow an ad hoc set of users to jointly sign a message. Multisignature schemes are often evaluated from the following perspectives: (1) the cryptographic assumptions underlying the schemes; (2) the operational assumptions about the bootstrapping of the schemes in practice; (3) the number of communication rounds for signing a message; (4) the time complexity for signing a message; (5) the amount of communication for signing a message; (6) the time complexity for verifying a multisignature; (7) the length of the resulting multisignatures. Existing multisignature schemes achieve various trade-offs among these measures, but none of them can achieve simultaneously the desired properties with respect to all (or even most) of these measures. In this paper, we present a novel multisignature scheme that offers desired properties with respect to the above (1)-(7) simultaneously, except that it uses random oracles (which however are often required in order to design practical schemes). In particular, our scheme is featured by its weak operational (i.e., plain public-key) model, non-interactive signing, and efficient verification.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was adopted to investigate the transcription of the estrogen-responsive genes in different developmental stages of zebrafish exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 17beta-estradiol for inducing vtg1 transcription were 0.25, 0.5, 0.25 and <or=0.1 microg/L for embryo, larvae, juvenile and adult male zebrafish, respectively, while the LOECs of nonylphenol for induction of vtgs transcription were 50 microg/L in embryo and 100 microg/L in larvae and adult stages. The mRNA levels of the two vtgs were low in both the embryo and larvae stages, even at the highest 17beta-estradiol or nonylphenol exposure concentrations, while the mRNA levels in liver of adult zebrafish of the two vtgs were 10(2) or even 10(4) times higher than those of the control groups at the corresponding nonylphenol or 17beta-estradiol exposure concentrations. Similarity, the ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA levels in juvenile and adult zebrafish livers were also higher. Results suggest that in the early developmental stages of zebrafish might be more sensitive (low LOECs) to the presence of EDCs such as nonylphenol, but juvenile and adult zebrafish have a more effective (high induction levels).

However, only few studies considered toxic effects of AgNPs on plant offspring, especially on flowering. Arabidopsis thaliana was treated with 12.5\\u202fmg/kg AgNPs employing parental-(P-AgNPs) and offspring-generation (O-AgNPs) exposure to study the effects of AgNPs on flowering and floral development. Exposure to P-AgNPs was found to significantly decrease petal and pollen viability and subsequently reduced pod production. The inhibition of A. thaliana vegetative growth caused by P-AgNPs exposure was transferred to offspring and even became more severe in the O-AgNPs group. Further, the transcription of genes related to flowering and floral organ development in P-AgNPs and O-Con plants was downregulated by approximately 10-40% compared to the transcription in P-Con plants and showed a stronger decrease in the O-AgNPs group to 30-50% of that in the P-AgNPs group. This resulted in a delay in flowering of 4, 3 and 8 days in P-AgNPs, O-Con and O-AgNPs plants, respectively. Our research shows that the negative effects on floral development can be transferred to the offspring in A. thaliana, which may have significant implications with regard to the risks posed by NPs to food safety and security.',\n",

Particularly of interest are the high levels of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) which can be obtained during germination. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the effect of germination on the physicochemical properties of brown rice.Germination altered the chemical composition of brown rice, resulting in an increase in reducing sugar and ash content, and a reduction in amylose. Solubility, paste viscosity, transition temperatures (T(o) , T(p) and T(c) ) and percentage of retrogradation (%Retrogradation) were decreased, while swelling power and turbidity were significantly increased. Scanning electron micrographs indicated that starch granules from germinated brown rice became smaller and less homogeneous.

Ultra-filtration, ammonium precipitation and column chromatography were used successively to purify the BaAFPs, and MALDI-TOF-MS/MS was used for protein identification. The results showed that infiltration-centrifugation was more targeted than the traditional method, and 10h was the optimal infiltration time.

       "  'abstract': 'Copper (Cu) is one of the most toxic metals in phytoplankton but the toxicity mechanisms of this metal are still not fully understood. This study examines the toxicity targets of Cu in the modeled marine diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, at the physiological (cell division, DNA cell cycle), biochemical [pigments synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA)], structural (subcellular observation by flow cytometry) and molecular (transcription of several metalloprotein genes) level. Cu toxicity was detectable at all these levels after 48 h of exposure to a parts per thousand yen20 mu M total initial added Cu. The order of sensitivity of all the studied Cu toxicity endpoints was: G2/M phase > MDA > metalloproteins RNA of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC) > metalloproteins RNA of the respiratory chains > G0/G1 phase > pigments a parts per thousand S phase > propidium iodide > estimated cell yield > ROS. The relatively sensitive decrease of the transcription of metalloproteins RNA of the ETC in response to Cu exposure, if associated to an effective decrease in the expression of the proteins composing the ETC, may help to initially mitigate the ROS-mediated toxic effects of Cu in P. tricornutum. However, this cellular response to Cu was only transitory and the transcription of virtually all genes involved in redox electron transfer chains was up-regulated within an interval of 2 days. This study brings new insights into the cellular mechanisms of Cu toxicity by documenting the sensitivity and kinetics of multiple Cu-cellular targets in one marine alga.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'PCR-DGGE was applied to analyze the microbial communities in rotating drum biofilter (RDB) for nitric oxide denitrifying removal under anaerobic conditions. The 16S rRNA genes (V3 region) were amplified with two universal primers (338F-GC and 518R). These amplified DNA fragments were separated by parallel DGGE. The DGGE profiles of biofilm samples from different sections of RDB are similar and about sixteen types of microorganisms are identified in the biofilm samples. These results show that microbial diversity of RDB firstly increases but then decreases with the addition of Cu II (EDTA) and the increase of NO removal efficiency. However, the change of microbial community is not significant during the process. Eight major bands of 16S rRNA genes fragments from DGGE profiles of biofilm samples were further eluted from gel, re-amplified, cloned and sequenced. The sequences of these fragments were compared with the database in GeneBank (NCBI). The gene analysis of 16S rRNA showed that the major populations are Cytopahga-Flexibacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) group Bacteroides, beta -Proteobacterium, gamma-Proteobacterium and Clostridium sp.. In addition, denitrification is related with band G-5, G-6 and G-8. G-5 is affiliated with gamma-Proteobacterium. Both G-6 and G-8 are affiliated with beta-Proteobacterium.',\n",

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of residual plastic film pollution on soil microbe community structure and fertility in Xinjiang province, China. Residual plastic film-contaminated soil and non-contaminated soil in Xinjiang farmland were selected for this study. The results indicated that residual plastic film pollution changed the structure of the soil biological community by significantly decreasing and increasing the abundance of  and , respectively; further, the pollution decreased soil organic matter and inorganic nitrogen content by downregulating microbial genes related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and decreasing related enzymatic activities.

       "  'abstract': 'Atrazine, a highly toxic herbicide, is frequently detected in surface water because of its heavy application. Algae are among the aquatic organisms most susceptible to atrazine pollution in water. In the present study, the aquatic alga Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck was chosen to assess the acute toxicity of atrazine (48-96 h) in terms of gene transcription and physiological changes. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to quantify transcript levels of three photosystem genes in C. vulgaris. The diel patterns for regulation of the psaB (photosystem I reaction center protein subunit B), psbC (an integral membrane protein component of photosystem II), and rbcL (large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase) gene transcripts were successfully quantified. Results showed that atrazine reduced the transcript abundances of three target genes and that the abundances decreased with increasing atrazine concentration. The determined smallest transcript levels of psaB, psbC, and rbcL, which occurred at the highest atrazine concentration tested (400 mug/L), were only 34.6, 34.6, and 8.1%, respectively, of the control sample value. Exposure to atrazine increased the level of malondialdehyde by 1.74-fold (the highest value) in C. vulgaris, suggesting potential oxidative damage to the alga. The activities of antioxidation enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) also increased markedly in the presence of atrazine, with maximum increases of 1.82-, 1.59-, and 2.31-fold, respectively. These elevated activities may help to alleviate the oxidative damage. Our results demonstrate that atrazine is highly toxic to this alga and that real-time PCR is an efficient technique for assessing the toxicity of xenobiotic compounds in algae.',\n",

Our results indicated enantiomeric differences in plant growth between R-IM and S-IM; 133\\xa0µg/kg R-IM showed heavier inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency and greater changes to subcellular structure than S-IM. R-IM and S-IM also had different effects on metabolism and leaf microorganisms. S-IM mainly increased lipid compounds and decreased amino acids, while R-IM increased sugar accumulation. The relative abundance of Moraxellaceae human pathogenic bacteria was increased by R-IM treatment, indicating that R-IM treatment may increase leaf surface pathogenic bacteria.

It is assumed that there is no direct link between the source and the destination, and the buffer-aided relay forwards the information to the destination by employing the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme. Both the source and the relay transmissions are assumed to be vulnerable to the eavesdropper. The perfect channel side information (CSI) of the network is assumed to be available at the source and the relay. Initially, conventional relaying protocols where equal partition of the time for the reception and transmission of the relay is considered. Then, the optimal time fraction with the optimal power control policy that maximizes the secrecy throughput is identified. Subsequently, the optimal joint link selection and power control policy that maximizes the secrecy throughput is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint link selection and power control scheme can significantly improve the achievable secrecy throughput of the buffer-aided two-hop communication system.',\n",

High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that AZ promoted the growth of Cyanobacteria in microcosms, and both PYR and AZ disturbed the ecological balance in the aquatic bacterial community and created distinct ecological risks.

In this paper, we first construct a basic protocol SAPAKE by using the homomorphic encryption scheme and an auxiliary memory device. Compared with the previous ones, SAPAKE is more suitable for those privacy-sensitive applications (e.g., cloud computing) where reducing server payload and improving user experience are both essential. Furthermore, we refine SAPAKE by removing the use of the memory device to gain an enhanced extension SAPAKE+ without increasing the resources consumption. SAPAKE+ achieves better user-friendliness than SAPAKE while it requires publishing more public parameters. Both of our protocols are practical due to their low (computation and communication) resources consumption and better user-friendliness, and achieve provable security in the random oracle model.

A linear-time algorithm is first demonstrated for DC analysis, and is then extended to perform transient analysis. The method has the desirable property of localizing computation, so that it shows massive benefits over conventional methods when only a small part of the grid is to be analyzed (for example, when the effects of small changes to the grid are to be examined). Even for the full analysis of the grid, experimental results show tat the method is faster than existing approaches and has an acceptable error margin. This method has been applied to test circuits of up to 2.3M nodes. For example, for a circuit with 70K nodes, the solution time for a single node was 0.42 sec and the complete solution was obtained in 17.6 sec.',\n",

With MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifiers, we demonstrate a number of advantages. Without needing any adversarial training, the proposed classifiers exceed the state of the art in robustness against white-box L2-bounded adversarial attacks.

       "  'abstract': 'Microalgae use various cellular mechanisms to detoxify both non-essential and excess essential metals or metalloids. There exists however, a threshold in intracellular metal(loid) concentrations beyond which detoxification mechanisms are no longer effective and inhibition of cell division inevitably occurs. It is therefore important to determine whether the availability of energy in the cell could constrain metal(loid) detoxification capacity and to better define the thresholds beyond which a metal(loid) becomes toxic. To do this we performed the first extensive bioenergetics analysis of intracellular metal(loid) detoxification mechanisms (e.g., metal-binding peptides, polyphosphate granules, metal efflux, metal and metalloid reduction, metalloid methylation, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants) in wild-type eukaryotic phytoplankton based on the biochemical mechanisms of each detoxification strategy and on experimental measurements of detoxifying biomolecules in the literature. The results show that at the onset of metal(loid) toxicity to growth, all the detoxification strategies considered required only a small fraction of the total cellular energy available for growth indicating that intracellular detoxification ability in wild-type eukaryotic phytoplankton species is not constrained by the availability of cellular energy. The present study brings new insights into metal(loid) toxicity mechanisms and detoxification strategies in wild-type eukaryotic phytoplankton.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This thesis presents two new linear equation solvers, and investigates their applications in VLSI design automation. Both solvers are derived in the context of a special class of large-scale sparse left-hand-side matrices that are commonly encountered in engineering applications, and techniques are presented that can potentially extend the theory to more general cases. The first is a stochastic solver that performs the computation by establishing the equivalence between linear equations and random walks. It has a desirable locality feature: a single unknown variable can be evaluated without solving the entire system. For complete solutions, it is competitive in applications with moderate accuracy requirement. The second is a hybrid solver: it combines the random walk technique and traditional iterative approaches. Given a set of linear equations, if the left-hand-side matrix satisfies certain conditions, it is proven that an incomplete triangular factorization can be obtained from random walks, and these factors can be used as a preconditioner in a traditional iterative linear equation solver to accelerate its convergence. In other words, the proposed hybrid solver is a stochastically preconditioned iterative solver. It is argued that our factor matrices have better quality, i.e., better accuracy-size tradeoffs, than preconditioners produced by existing incomplete factorization methods. Therefore the hybrid solver requires less computation than traditional preconditioned iterative solvers to solve a set of linear equations with the same error tolerance, and the advantage increases for larger and denser sets of linear equations. The application of these solvers on several problems in VLSI design is illustrated in this thesis, namely, power grid analysis, chip-level electrostatic discharge simulation, and quadratic placement. We not only demonstrate the efficiency of direct usage of the solvers, but also devise a set of application-specific techniques that are often based on indirect usage of the stochastic solver, due to the fact that the localized computation process of random walks carries meaningful information in various scenarios.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Microplastic pollution is pervasive in aquatic environments, but the potential effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms are still under debate. Given that tissue damage is unavoidable in fish and the available data mostly concentrate on healthy fish, there is a large chance that the ecotoxicological risk of microplastic pollution is underrated. Therefore, in this study, the effects of microplastics on the regenerative capacity of injured fish were investigated using a zebrafish caudal fin regeneration model. After fin amputation at 72\\xa0h post fertilization, the larvae were exposed to polystyrene microplastics (0.1-10\\xa0mg/L) with diameters of 50 or 500\\xa0nm. Microplastic exposure significantly inhibited fin regeneration, both morphologically and functionally. Furthermore, the signaling networks that regulate fin regeneration, as well as reactive oxygen species signaling and the immune response, both of which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration, were altered. Transcriptomic analyses of the regenerating fin confirmed that genes related to fin regeneration were transcriptionally modulated in response to microplastic exposure and that metabolic pathways were also extensively involved. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that microplastic exposure could disrupt the regenerative capacity of fish and might eventually impair their fitness in the wild.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In order to find novel natural antioxidant peptides, the water hyacinth leaf protein was hydrolyzed by Protamex at optimum condition to prepared water hyacinth leaf protein hydrolysate (WHLPH). And antioxidant properties of WHLPH were evaluated dependent on several in vitro antioxidant systems, including superoxide anion radical-scavenging activity, ABTS cation radical-scavenging activity, reducing power, and metal chelating capacity. WHLPH showed 86.37% of superoxide anion radical-scavenging activity at 1.0\\xa0mg/mL, and 56.51% of ABTS cation radical-scavenging activity at 100\\xa0μg/mL. At 1.0\\xa0mg/mL, the reducing power of WHLPH was 0.92, and the metal chelating capacity was 68.54%. Subsequently, the WHLPH was subjected to consecutive isolation and purification by macroporous resin, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and two peptide fractions with higher radical-scavenging activity were acquired. Finally, the two peptide fractions were identified to be Phe-Phe-Glu and Leu-Phe, respectively, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Considering the two peptides’ amino acid composition, their antioxidant properties may be due to the hydrophobic and/or aromatic acid residues in their sequences. The results indicated that the isolated antioxidant peptides from WHLPH would find widespread application in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industry because of their high potency, safety, low cost and abundant source.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hearing-impaired people, and particularly hearing-aid and cochlear-implant users, often have difficulty communicating over the telephone. The intelligibility of telephone speech is considerably lower than the intelligibility of face-to-face speech. This is partly because of lack of visual cues, limited telephone bandwidth, and background noise. In addition, cellphones may cause interference with the hearing aid or cochlear implant. To address these problems that hearing-impaired people experience with telephones, this paper proposes a wireless phone adapter that can be used to route the audio signal directly to the hearing aid or cochlear implant processor. This adapter is based on Bluetooth technology. The favorable features of this new wireless technology make the adapter superior to traditional assistive listening devices. A hardware prototype was built and software programs were written to implement the headset profile in the Bluetooth specification. Three cochlear implant users were tested with the proposed phone-adapter and reported good speech quality.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The recent growth of anonymous social network services -- such as 4chan, Whisper, and Yik Yak -- has brought online anonymity into the spotlight. For these services to function properly, the integrity of user anonymity must be preserved. If an attacker can determine the physical location from where an anonymous message was sent, then the attacker can potentially use side information (for example, knowledge of who lives at the location) to de-anonymize the sender of the message. In this paper, we investigate whether the popular anonymous social media application Yik Yak is susceptible to localization attacks, thereby putting user anonymity at risk. The problem is challenging because Yik Yak application does not provide information about distances between user and message origins or any other message location information. We provide a comprehensive data collection and supervised machine learning methodology that does not require any reverse engineering of the Yik Yak protocol, is fully automated, and can be remotely run from anywhere. We show that we can accurately predict the locations of messages up to a small average error of 106 meters. We also devise an experiment where each message emanates from one of nine dorm colleges on the University of California Santa Cruz campus. We are able to determine the correct dorm college that generated each message 100\\\\\\\\% of the time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: The ongoing emission of nitric oxide (NO) is a serious persistent environmental problem, because it contributes to atmospheric ozone destruction and global warming. A novel and effective system was developed for the complete treatment of NO from flue gases. The system features NO absorption by FeII(EDTA) and biological denitrification in a rotating drum biofilter (RDB). RESULTS: After 100 mg L-1 FeII(EDTA) was added to the nutrient solution, the results show that the NO removal efficiency was improved from 70.56% to 80.15%, the optimal temperature improved from 32.5 °C to 40.5 °C, and the pH improved from 7.5 to 8.0-8.3. A maximum NO removal efficiency of 96.5% was achieved when 500 mg L-1 FeII(EDTA) was used in the nutrient solution. CONCLUSION: This experiment demonstrates that FeII(EDTA) could not only improve the mass transfer efficiency of NO from gas to liquid, but also serve as an electron donor for the biological reduction of NO to N2. The new integrated treatment system seemed to be a promising alternative for the complete treatment of NO from flue gases. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.',\n",

ΔH of the complexes increased sharply from 0.91 to 1.40\\u202fJ/g with increased frying temperature, while it initially increased from 1.01 to 1.40\\u202fJ/g and then decreased rapidly to 1.17\\u202fJ/g with prolonged frying time. These observations were consistent with the results of relative crystallinity. Rapid viscosity analysis showed that the viscosities decreased by the increasing frying temperature or the prolonging frying time.

The results showed that DWGRMPI had a higher nitrogen solubility index, fat absorption capacity, foaming capacity, foaming stability and emulsifying stability compared to DWGPI, whilst water holding capacity, surface hydrophobicity and emulsifying activity of DWGRMPI were relatively lower than those of DWGPI. DWGRMPI contained high levels of threonine, histidine, alanine, arginine, glycine, serine, cysteine, proline and especially lysine compared to DWGPI. The denaturation temperature and denaturation enthalpy of DWGPI were both lower than those of DWGRMPI, and DWGPI contained more random coil and less α-helix than DWGRMPI, which suggested that DWGPI has lost its ordered secondary structure.

There is little knowledge about the interactions between metal compound toxicity and photoperiod or temperature. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of photoperiod and temperature on cadmium (Cd) toxicity in the fresh alga, Chlorella vulgaris, both singly and in combination. Exposure to 2 or 4 microM Cd alone significantly decreased the transcription of the photosynthesis-related genes psbA, psaB and rbcL. Three-way ANOVA analysis showed that both temperature and photoperiod interacted with the dosage of Cd to influence the abundance of psbA and psaB, but not rbcL. Specifically, psbA transcription was more sensitive to Cd under long photoperiods or high temperatures than under short photoperiods or low temperatures. Because photoperiod and temperature have certain impacts on the toxicity of metal compounds, these two environmental factors should be given more attention in laboratory research.',\n",

Our results showed that 40 μM SA increased the total fatty acid content accumulation 1.3-fold of the control after 4 days of exposure. The metabolomics data indicated that SA stimulated the fatty acid monostearin, 2-monoolein, monoolein, and methyl palmitoleate to 22.7-, 16.3-, 3.47-, and 3.47-fold of the control, respectively. The results of physiological and gene transcriptional levels revealed that the glycolysis, N assimilation, and fatty acid synthesis pathways were induced by SA treatment and thus accelerated fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrate and N compounds.

       "  'abstract': 'Homogenate and vacuum infiltration-centrifugation were adopted and compared in carrot antifreeze proteins (CaAFPs) extraction, and effects of CaAFPs on thermophysical properties, texture properties, cooking properties, and microstructure of frozen white salted noodles were studied. Results showed that the vacuum infiltration-centrifugation was more targeted than homogenate in CaAFPs extraction, while its protein extraction rate was much lower than homogenate. Differential scanning calorimeter measurement showed that CaAFPs could not only lower the initial point of freezing (T f) and the end point of freezing (T m��) of water but also decrease the freezable water content. It also confirmed that CaAFPs were enriched in apoplast extract. The addition of CaAFPs could lower the enthalpy of melting of frozen noodles. V-CaAFPs could lower T m�� of frozen noodles but the T m�� of H-noodles was slightly increased. Freezable water content of frozen noodles was decreased by the addition of CaAFPs and T g�� of them was increased. Texture profile analysis showed that texture properties of white salted noodles were significantly influenced (p < 0.05) by the addition of CaAFPs. Cooking properties of frozen white salted noodles were also significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) by increasing cooking absorption and reducing dry material loss. NMR measurement showed that the addition of CaAFPs could shift water from mobile state to less mobile state. Microstructure of noodles suggested that the addition of CaAFPs could protect the gluten network from the damage caused by freezing and temperature fluctuation, which resulted in an integrated gluten network in white salted noodles. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Microcystis aeruginosa is a primary species of toxin-producing cyanobacteria. This study explored the effects of short-term exposure (96\\u202fh) to M.\\xa0aeruginosa on the intestinal microflora variation and immune function of zebrafish. After exposure to different cell concentrations of M.\\xa0aeruginosa, marked histological variation was observed in the intestine, such as goblet cells proliferation and intestinal desquamation. In addition high-concentration M.\\xa0aeruginosa treatment (initial concentration: 1.59\\u202f×\\u202f10\\u202fcells mL) induced a significant increase in cytokine levels compared with other groups. Low-concentration M.\\xa0aeruginosa treatment (initial concentration: 0.88\\u202f×\\u202f10\\u202fcells mL) promoted the transcription of inflammatory genes, while high-concentration treatment restrained the transcription of these genes. Moreover, M.\\xa0aeruginosa exposure also changed the intestinal microbial diversity. At the phylum level, bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria were the most abundant in all groups, and Gammaproteobacteria were the dominant bacteria with major changes. Pathogenic microorganisms such as Shewanella, Plesiomonas, Halomonas, Pseudomonas, and Lactobacillus increased greatly after treatment with different cell concentrations of M.\\xa0aeruginosa. This study indicates that M.\\xa0aeruginosa induces an increase in zebrafish goblet cells and enhances the inflammatory response, which may produce detrimental effects in zebrafish, resulting in a greater proportion of pathogenic bacteria and intestinal injury. The results of this study will help improve the understanding of the effects of M.\\xa0aeruginosa on the intestines of aquatic organisms.',\n",

Interactions between toxic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algal competitors can affect toxic bloom formation, but the exact mechanisms of interspecies interactions remain unknown. Using metabolomic and proteomic profiling of co-cultures of the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa with a green alga as well as of microorganisms collected in a Microcystis spp. bloom in Lake Taihu (China), we disentangle novel interspecies allelopathic interactions. We describe an interspecies molecular network in which M. aeruginosa inhibits growth of Chlorella vulgaris, a model green algal competitor, via the release of linoleic acid. In addition, we demonstrate how M. aeruginosa takes advantage of the cell signaling compound nitric oxide produced by C. vulgaris, which stimulates a positive feedback mechanism of linoleic acid release by M. aeruginosa and its toxicity. Our high-throughput system-biology approach highlights the importance of previously unrecognized allelopathic interactions between a broadly distributed toxic cyanobacterial bloom former and one of its algal competitors.',\n",

A narrow-beam generated by each codeword is intended to provide coverage over certain beam range with strict constraints on the average and the variation in the radiated power. Each narrow-beam or codeword is designed based on a new performance metric, the ratio of the expected average power within the coverage beam range to that outside the beam range, i.e., beam-to-leakage ratio (BLR). An optimization problem for narrow-beam design is formulated to maximize the BLR. The codebook is generated via solving the optimization problem. Based on numerical evaluation, our novel codebook design based transmission scheme can improve the overall network throughput compared with the DFT-based and covariance based method when the angular spread of the channel is relative large or when the channel is rich scattering.',\n",

Three proton fractions with different mobility were observed in black beans during soaking, reflecting macromolecule, oil, and water in different microenvironments; the soaking process significantly changed the distribution of proton fractions in black beans.

NPs not only directly affect aquatic organisms but also adsorb other pollutants, causing combined pollution. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and is commonly monitored in freshwater systems. In this study, the effects of the combined toxicity of polystyrene cationic amino-modified nanoparticles (nPS-NH) and glyphosate on a blue-green alga, Microcystis aeruginosa, were investigated. Our results demonstrated that 5\\u202fmg/L glyphosate had a strong inhibitory effect on M.\\xa0aeruginosa (the 96-h inhibitory rate was 27%), while 5\\u202fmg/L nPS-NH had no apparent effect on the growth of M.\\xa0aeruginosa. Interestingly, nPS-NH combined with glyphosate showed antagonistic effects on the inhibition of algal growth because nPS-NH displayed a strong adsorption capacity for glyphosate, which significantly alleviated the inhibitory effect of glyphosate on M.\\xa0aeruginosa growth. However, the presence of glyphosate enhanced the stability of the dispersion system, which allowed more nPS-NH to adsorb on the surface of M.\\xa0aeruginosa and may result in greater enrichment of nPS-NH in the food chain to show potential repercussions to human life. Our current study provides a new theoretical basis for the combined effects of NPs and pesticide pollution.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Power consumption has become a major consideration in nanometer chip design. Since the dynamic power is proportional to V dd2, and the static power is proportional to V dd, lowering power supply voltage is an efficient method to reduce the power usage. In this paper, we adopt the row-based dual-supply voltage (DSV) scheme. DSV assigns a low power supply voltage to timing non-critical gates for the power saving. Contrary to the traditional region-based voltage island works, the row-based approach creates voltage islands along the circuit rows. This kind of fine grid voltage islands give more flexibility on gate voltage assignment such that the low voltage gates can be selected primarily based on timing and design logic, which in turn minimizes the shifter insertion. We present a two-stage flow to generate voltage islands for every two mirrored circuit rows and place gates legally inside each island. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work to cover latch and LCB (local clock buffer) handling and shifter placement in voltage island generation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.',\n",

This report investigated the effect of enantioselectivity between R- and S-IM in Arabidopsis thaliana on chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis. The results suggest that R-IM inhibited the transcription of chlM to a greater extent than S-IM, which reduced chlorophyll synthesis. R-IM also showed a stronger inhibitory effect than S-IM on the transcription of photosynthesis-related genes, affecting linear electron transport and CO(2) fixation. IM stress enantioselectively induced transcriptional upregulation of the ndhH gene, a representative of the NDH complex. In contrast, the expression of pgr5 was downregulated, which demonstrated that IM stress enhanced adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by stimulating an NDH-dependent and not ferredoxin (FD)-independent route. This study suggested that R-IM has a greater toxic effect on photosynthesis than S-IM, affecting plant growth through chlorophyll synthesis.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chromium (Cr) is one of the most serious pollutants in aquatic systems. This study examined the relationship between the toxic effects of Cr on the freshwater alga Chlorella vulgaris and phosphorus (P) availability on the algal physiology and ultrastructure. Cr inhibited C. vulgaris growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and its inhibitory effect was related to the P concentration. In a low-P medium, Cr showed approximately 2.2-3.7-fold stronger toxicity than in a high-P medium. Cr was absorbed into the algal body where it disrupted the chloroplast structure and decreased the chlorophyll content. However, Cr had a weaker chlorophyll inhibitory ability and destructive power against the chloroplasts in the high-P medium than in the low-P medium due to the partial blockage of Cr absorption in high P-medium. Cr exposure also changed the metal ion and anion absorption profiles, which was also closely related to the concentration of P. Cr treatment increased the volume of the vacuole, and the larger vacuole reduced the space available for chloroplasts, as based on optical and electron microscopy results, but a higher P availability could alleviate this damage. These results suggest that high P alleviated the toxicity of Cr by decreasing Cr absorption and increasing the absorption of beneficial ions. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the phosphorus availability when the toxicity of metal compounds is evaluated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Antimicrobial peptides are of greatest potential as a new group of antibiotics. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed using flavourzyme, pepsin, trypsin, neutrase, papain and alcalase to obtain antimicrobial peptides from ovalbumin. Pepsin hydrolysate exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity compared with other fractions. To purify and characterize antimicrobial peptide, an immobilized liposome-binding extraction method was developed, in which the liposome was regarded as a mimic biomembrane system. The immobilized liposome stationary phase was prepared, and the maximum adsorption capacity and Langmuir constant were 81.30 μM/g and 8.19 mL/mg, respectively. Four fragments were simultaneously predicted by the comparison between reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography chromatograms of pepsin hydrolysate before and after interaction with immobilized liposome membrane. A novel cationic antimicrobial peptide named Opep2 was sequenced as RVASMASEKMKI. In addition, antimicrobial mode experiments showed that Opep2 interacted with cell wall membrane and caused potassium efflux, nucleotide leakage and ultimately cell death. Because of the high efficiency and procedural simplicity, the immobilized liposome-binding extraction method could be more efficient for the screening of antimicrobial peptides than conventional methods, which provides scientific references for antimicrobial peptide production. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In a verifiable computation VC scheme, a client asks a server to perform some outsourced computations, and the latter returns the results as its response. The results can be verified privately or publicly. Fiore and Gennaro CCS 2012 constructed publicly verifiable protocols for secure outsourcing polynomials and matrix computations. Batch verifiable computation BVC schemes allow a client to outsource multiple functions on a same input, and thus much reduce the storage overhead at the server side without sacrificing the efficiency of verification. However, existing BVC schemes only support private verifiability which only allows the client who outsources the computations to verify the results. In this paper, we propose BVC schemes with public verifiability, i.e., any third party can efficiently verify the results returned by the server without accessing secret key. To delegate s functions, our BVC schemes require a cloud storage of only $$1+1/s$$ times the storage size needed by the s functions themselves. We extend our schemes to meet less cloud storage overhead as well.',\n",

For the targeted screening of antibacterial peptides, liposomes constructed from Staphylococcus aureus membrane lipids were used in an equilibrium dialysis system. The hydrolysate was further purified by liposome equilibrium dialysis combined with high performance liquid chromatography. The purified antimicrobial peptide (ACWWP1) was determined to be GLSRLFTALK, with a molecular weight of 1104.6622Da. The peptide exhibited no haemolytic activity up to a concentration of 512μg/ml. It displayed a dose-dependent bactericidal effect in reconstituted milk.

       "  'abstract': 'Wang and Yu proposed a block cipher scheme based on dynamic sequences generated by multiple chaotic systems, which overcomes the problem of periodical degradation on random sequences due to computational precision. Their scheme has a feature that a plaintext is encrypted by a keystream created from several one-dimensional chaotic maps. However, this feature results in some weaknesses of the encryption algorithm. We show three kinds of attacks in this paper, through which one can recover the plaintext from a given ciphertext without the secret key. We also present an improvement on their scheme, which prevents the three attacks mentioned above. Security of the enhanced cipher is presented and analyzed, which shows that our improved scheme is secure under the current attacks. Copyright 2010 Jun He et al.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study investigated the effects of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, an effective allelochemical on aquatic unicellular algae Chlorella vulgaris at physiological gene transcription level. Exposure to 2.5 mg L(-1) of N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), which were 2.47, 3.24, and 4.27 times higher than that of the control, however, exposure to 4.0 mg L(-1) N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine decreased the activities of these antioxidant enzymes. An increase in malondialdehyde content and a decrease in chlorophyll content following exposure to N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine suggested that the alga was severely damaged and that cell growth was greatly inhibited. Electron microscopy showed that the plasma membrane was detached from the cell wall, the nucleus was condensed, and the structure of chloroplasts was disrupted, in response to N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine exposure. Real-time PCR showed that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine reduced the transcript abundance of psaB and psbC to 3% and 1% of the control, respectively. These results demonstrated that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine not only inhibited photosynthesis, but also triggered the synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to disrupt the subcellular structure of this aquatic organism.',\n",

The present study investigated the effects of Ser on the structures of aquatic microbial communities via high-throughput sequencing analyses. Ser-HCl treatment inhibited the growth of two model algae (the green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, and the cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa) and decreased the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration in the microcosm to reduce the photosynthetic efficiency. High-throughput sequencing analyses showed that exposure to Ser-HCl disturbed the balance of cyanobacteria species by stimulating the growth of specific cyanobacteria. Among eukaryotes, the richness as well as the diversity indices were significantly enhanced after 5\\u202fdays of Ser-HCl treatment but sharply decreased with exposure time. Nucleariida occupied an absolute majority (97.83%) within the eukaryotes, implicating that Ser-HCl disturbed the ecological equilibrium in microcosms. Ser-HCl will continue to be an environmental contaminant due to its wide usage and production. Our current study clarified the potential ecological risk of Ser-HCl to aquatic microorganisms. These findings suggest that more attention should be given to the negative effects of these bioactive pollutants on aquatic environments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cloud storage provides tremendous storage resources for both individual and enterprise users. In a cloud storage system, the data owned by a user are no longer possessed locally. Hence, it is not competent to ensure the integrity of the outsourced data using traditional data integrity checking methods. A privacy-preserving public auditing protocol allows a third party auditor to check the integrity of the outsourced data on behalf of the users without violating the privacy of the data. However, existing privacy-preserving public auditing protocols assume that the end devices of users are powerful enough to compute all costly operations in real time when the data to be outsourced are given. In fact, the end devices may also be those with low computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose two lightweight privacy-preserving public auditing protocols. Our protocols are based on online/offline signatures, by which an end device only needs to perform lightweight computations when a file to be outsourced is available. Besides, our proposals support batch auditing and data dynamics. Experiments show that our protocols are hundreds of times more efficient than a recent proposal regarding to the computational overhead on user side.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Microcystis aeruginosa, a primary species in cyanobacterial blooms, is ubiquitously distributed in water. Microcystins (MCs) purified from M.\\xa0aeruginosa can exert reproductive toxicity in fish. However, the effects of M.\\xa0aeruginosa at environmentally relevant levels on the reproductive and endocrine systems of zebrafish are still unknown. The present study investigated the reproductive and endocrine-disrupting toxicity of M.\\xa0aeruginosa on female zebrafish (Danio rerio) by short-term exposure (96\\xa0h). After exposure, marked histological lesions in the liver or gonads, such as nuclear pyknosis and deformation, were observed, and the fertilization rate and hatchability of eggs spawned from treated females were both significantly lower than they were in females in the control group, suggesting the possibility of transgenerational effects of M.\\xa0aeruginosa exposure. Moreover, M.\\xa0aeruginosa exposure decreased the concentration of 17β-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in female zebrafish. Interestingly, the vtg1 transcriptional level significantly decreased in the liver, whereas plasma vitellogenin (VTG) protein levels increased. The present findings indicate that M.\\xa0aeruginosa could modulate endocrine function by disrupting transcription of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver (HPGL) axis-related genes, and impair the reproductive capacity of female zebrafish, suggesting that M.\\xa0aeruginosa causes potential adverse effects on fish reproduction in Microcystis bloom-contaminated aquatic environments.',\n",

Due to the increasing use of polymorphic malware, detection is becoming more difficult. To this end, ensemble learning has been proposed to improve accuracy in malware detection, without severely sacrificing time complexity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid detection system, TFBOOST, which incorporates the tensor filter algorithm into boosting ensemble generalization architecture, in order to improve detection efficacy. TFBOOST uses a static analysis to extract features and a level-by-level boosting structure with re-sampling process to diversify base learners. Experimental results show that TFBOOST generally outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble algorithms with higher detection precision and lower false positive rates.

The decrease in soil urease activity and the increase in the relative abundance of Nitrospirae after SWCNTs exposure might be relevant to the induction of soil nitrification. The relative abundances of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms increased after exposure to SWCNTs, which was beneficial for phosphorus bioavailability in the soil.

This paper presents the following three contributions. (1) We point out the weaknesses of Brzuska et al.'s (PKC 2009) and Canard et al.'s (CT-RSA 2010) constructions respectively. Namely we show that their constructions are not signer-accountable. (2) We point out the weakness of Brzuska et al.'s security model (PKC 2009) for sanitizable signatures by showing some potential attacks neglected in their original model. (3) We present a stronger security model based on Brzuska et al.'s model and a fullysecure construction based on both Brzuska et al.'s and Canard et al.'s constructions. We must note that our proposed construction is much more practical than prior ones. In detail, the computation costs of signing, sanitizing and verification algorithm are constant and the signature size is constant as well.\",\n",

Empirical evaluation by two link prediction benchmarks, one in coauthorship networks and one in Wikipedia, shows promising results.

       "  'abstract': 'Herbicides present in the environment induce oxidative stress in plants. We investigated the roles of exogenous NO-regulated chlorophyll synthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity and gene expression in herbicide-treated unicellular green algae Chlorella vulgaris. Atrazine (100 microg/L) or glufosinate (10 mg/L) treatment alone or in combination with 20 microM sodium nitroprussiate (SNP, 10 microM with glufosinate) was administered to algae for a short time period of 48 h to observe changes in physiology and gene transcription and expression. Supplementation of atrazine or glufosinate with low SNP significantly reduced H2O2, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induction by herbicides. Supplementation also increased chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity, as compared to herbicide treatment alone. This trend suggests an effect of NO on the scavenging of ROS. Furthermore, the expression of photosynthesis genes (psbC, psaB, chlB and rbcL) was also upregulated by supplementation of low SNP, thus maintaining the normal photosynthetic function. However, high concentration of SNP (100 microM) in combination with herbicides aggravated damage to algae, including increases in H2O2, ROS and MDA and decreases in chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzyme activity and photosynthesis genes transcription. 2-Phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO), the NO scavenger, was also examined in this study; the results showed that PTIO could neutralise the effect of low SNP. Data also showed that an exogenous supply of NO protects Chlorella vulgaris against the toxicity of herbicides by protecting against oxidant substances and increasing the transcription of related genes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In cloud computing, computationally weak users are always willing to outsource costly computations to a cloud, and at the same time they need to check the correctness of the result provided by the cloud. Such activities motivate the occurrence of verifiable computation (VC). Recently, Parno, Raykova and Vaikuntanathan showed any VC protocol can be constructed from an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme for a same class of functions. In this paper, we propose two practical and efficient semi-adaptively secure key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) schemes with constant-size ciphertexts. The semi-adaptive security requires that the adversary designates the challenge attribute set after it receives public parameters but before it issues any secret key query, which is stronger than selective security guarantee. Our first construction deals with small universe while the second one supports large universe. Both constructions employ the technique underlying the prime-order instantiation of nested dual system groups, which are based on the $d$-linear assumption including SXDH and DLIN assumptions. In order to evaluate the performance, we implement our ABE schemes using $\\\\\\\\textsf{Python}$ language in Charm. Compared with previous KP-ABE schemes with constant-size ciphertexts, our constructions achieve shorter ciphertext and secret key sizes, and require low computation costs, especially under the SXDH assumption.',\n",

Seo and Sun pointed out that Park and Lee's scheme can't resist the forgery attack from the original signer. To provide the unforgeablity and nonrepudiation, Seo et al also proposed a new nominative proxy signature scheme for mobile communication. However, in the paper, we show that the new scheme can't satisfy the non-repudiation among their security requirement either. Based on Seo et al's scheme, an improved scheme is proposed. The improved scheme can resist not only the attack mentioned in Seo and Sun's schemes, but also the attack proposed by us to Seo et al's scheme. Also, the improved version retains the advantages of Seo et al's scheme.

       "  'abstract': 'Algal blooms have been increasing in prevalence all over the world, destroying ecosystems and placing other organisms at risk. Chemical remediation is one of most important methods of controlling algal bloom formation. The effects of copper sulfate, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine on photosynthesis-related and microcystin-related gene transcription and physiological changes of Microcystis aeruginosa were analyzed. The results suggest that transcription of psaB, psbD1 and rbcL was inhibited by the three algaecides, which blocked the electron transport chain, significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and overwhelmed the antioxidant system. The increase in ROS destroyed pigment synthesis and membrane integrity, which inhibited or killed the algal cells. Furthermore, H(2)O(2) treatment down-regulated mcyD transcription, which indicated a decrease in the microcystin level in the cells. Our results demonstrate that H(2)O(2) has the greatest potential as an algaecide because it not only inhibits algae growth but may reduce microcystin synthesis.',\n",

In this study, we selected Japonica rice variety Xiushui 63 seedlings to evaluate the enantioselectivity of imazethapyr (IM). Significant differences in rice seedling morphology, antioxidant enzyme, oxidant marker and gene transcription were observed between the two IM enantiomers. In the seedling morphological assay, IM enantiomers inhibited elongation of primary roots and shoots, and reduced the number of adventitious roots and the density of root hairs. The inhibitory effects were enhanced with increasing concentrations of IM. The maximal root relative inhibition rate reached 80.4%, 67.0%, and 73.5% for R-(-)-IM, S-(+)-IM and racemate at the concentration of 0.5 mg L(-1), respectively, and the maximal shoot relative inhibition rate reached 77.7%, 26.9%, and 61.7%, respectively. The activities of SOD, POD and CAT and the content of MDA increased at 0.5 mg L(-1) of R-(-)-IM treatment, and were 1.8, 3.3, 1.4, and 2.2 times, respectively, over the activities S-(+)-IM. Real-time PCR showed that R-(-)-IM minimized the transcript abundance of ALS in shoot tissue to 12.2% of the S-(+)-IM, and minimized the transcript abundance of PC in seed to 9.2% of the S-(+)-IM. R-(-)-IM maximized the transcript abundance of beta-amylase in shoots to 8.6-time of the S-(+)-IM. Results from this study imply that R-(-)-IM has stronger toxicity on the growth of rice than S-(+)-IM.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The acute (3 days) and chronic (whole life history) responses of Arabidopsis thaliana following exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Ag ions (AgNO) in respectively a hydroponic medium and in soil were studied. After 3\\u202fdays of hydroponic exposure, AgNPs (1.0 and 2.5\\u202fmg/L) exerted more severe inhibitory effects on plant (shoot and root) growth and photosynthesis than the same concentrations of Ag ions. In soil cultivation, the photoperiod, the autonomous, and the vernalization pathways were down-regulated to 0.15- to 0.5-fold of the control after 12.5\\u202fmg/kg AgNPs treatment. This exposure caused a decrease of approximately 25%-40% as compared to the control of the transcription of flowering key genes including AP1, LFY, FT and SOC1, and finally resulted in a delayed flowering time of 5\\u202fdays. Only autonomous and vernalization pathways were inhibited by Ag ion treatment and ultimately the time of flowering in treated plants was delayed by 3\\u202fdays. The energy production related metabolic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in sugar metabolism were stimulated stronger by AgNPs than by Ag ion treatment, thus releasing more energy and accelerating the physiological metabolic responses against stress in the AgNPs treatment while subsequently reducing the plant growth and yield at the maturation stage. Importantly, shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and tryptophan and galactose metabolisms were regulated only by the AgNPs treatment, which was a specific effect of nanoparticles.

       "  'abstract': 'S-metolachlor (S-ME) is a widely used chiral herbicide that can cause potential ecological risks via long-term usage. In this work, we chose a model plant, wheat, as the test material to determine the effects of applying 10\\xa0mg/kg S-ME to soil on its fresh weight, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the diversity and structural composition of the phyllosphere microorganisms after 7 and 14\\xa0days of exposure. Our work showed that this concentration of residual S-ME in soil only slightly decreased plant biomass and had little effect on lipid peroxidation, the antioxidant enzyme system and chlorophyll content. Interestingly, although the test concentration of S-ME did not exert strong inhibitory effects on the physiological activities of wheat, it decreased the diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities and changed their structure, indicating that microorganisms were more sensitive stress indicators. S-ME reduced the colonization by some beneficial bacteria related to plant nitrogen fixation among the phyllosphere microorganisms, which influenced the growth and yield of wheat because these bacteria contribute to plant fitness. In addition, S-ME affected the association between the host and the composition of the phyllosphere microbial communities under different growth conditions. Our work provides insights into the ecological implications of the effects of herbicides on the phyllosphere microbiome.',\n",

BHLPE was found to have strong superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power and moderate metal ion-chelating activity. Compared with a high fat diet (HFD) group, mice that were administered 600mg BHLPE/kg body weight showed significant decreases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the atherosclerosis index, in addition to markedly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the antioxidant defense system and antioxidant gene expression were significantly improved in vivo in mice that were administered BHLPE compared with mice in the HFD group.

The results of physiological and gene transcriptional levels revealed that the glycolysis, N assimilation, and fatty acid synthesis pathways were induced by SA treatment and thus accelerated fatty acid synthesis from carbohydrate and N compounds.

With the demand for antibiotics increasing every year, it is necessary to assess potential environmental risks and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) associated with antibiotic production. Here, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of ARGs in soil in the vicinity of a pharmaceutical factory. The results showed that antibiotic concentrations were under the detection limit; however, ARGs were present in soil and tended to be enriched near the factory. A significant correlation between the relative abundance of intI-1 and tetracycline ARGs implied that horizontal gene transfer might play an important role in the spread of ARGs. The occurrence of these ARGs could be the results of previous antibiotic contamination. However, the soil bacterial community structure seemed to be more affected by nutrients or other factors than by antibiotics. Overall, this study supports the viewpoint that long-term pharmaceutical activity might have a negative effect on environmental health, thus, underscoring the need to regulate antibiotic production and management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Deniable authentication protocol is an authentication protocol that allows a sender to authenticate a message for a receiver, in a way that the receiver cannot convince a third party that such authentication ever took place. In recent years, due to the popularity of Internet and its special property, many deniable authentication protocols have been proposed. However, most of these proposed schemes are interactive and less efficient. To our knowledge, Shao has proposed an efficient non-interactive deniable authentication protocol based on generalized ElGamal signature scheme without security proof. Lu et al have proposed a deniable authentication also, however, the protocol suffers from the receiver's attack who once interacts with the sender. For the reason above, we would like to propose a generic method to construct efficient non-interactive deniable authentication protocols from any trapdoor permutations. Using RSA trapdoor permutations we introduce a new digital signature with tight security and use it to construct a concrete deniable authentication protocol. Concentrated on security problem we prove the protocol secure in random oracle. We also believe that the protocol is much efficient and practical in application with non-interactive property.\",\n",

This paper describes the contents and structural changes of both starch and protein in leached solids and rice kernels. Under actual cooking conditions, the leached solids increased with heating temperature and then decreased at specific temperatures relating gelatinization. Starch content of leached solids increased with the heating temperature, especially after gelatinization. As proteins are mainly distributed on the surface of the kernel, their release increased between 30 and 50 °C but then decreased with increasing leaching of starch at high temperatures. The molecular weight distribution of leached solids at different temperatures is significantly different, while it is similar in rice kernels. At 30-50 °C, the amylose contents in the leached solids were slightly higher than those in rice kernel, while the contents were similar at high temperatures. The transformation of the kernel structure during heating confirmed that the kernel surface and the formed cracks are the main path for leaching; the rearranged structures of the surface and cracks influence the final texture of cooked rice.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Privacy-Preserving Locally Weighted Linear Regression Over Encrypted Millions of Data.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The emerging development of cloud computing makes a trend that the cloud becomes a outsourced agglomeration for storing big data that generally contains numerous information. To mine the rich value involved in big data, the machine learning methodology is widespread employed due to its ability to adapt to data changes. However, the data mining process may involve the privacy issues of the users, hence they are reluctant to share their information. This is the reason why the outsourced data need to be dealt with securely, where data encryption is considered to be the most straightforward method to keep the privacy of data, but machine learning on the data in ciphertext domain is more complicated than the plaintext, since the relationship structure between data is no longer maintained, in such a way that we focus on the machine learning over encrypted big data. In this work, we study locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), a widely used classic machine learning algorithm in real-world, such as predict and find the best-fit curve through numerous data points. To tackle the privacy concerns in utilizing the LWLR algorithm, we present a system for privacy-preserving locally weighted linear regression, where the system not only protects the privacy of users but also encrypts the best-fit curve. Therefore, we use Paillier homomorphic encryption as the building modular to encrypt data and then apply the stochastic gradient descent in encrypted domain. After given a security analysis, we study how to let Paillier encryption deal with real numbers and implement the system in Python language with a couple of experiments on real-world data sets to evaluate the effectiveness, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art and occurs negligible errors compared with performing locally weighted linear regression in the clear.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'WeChat, both a location-based social network (LBSN) and an online social network (OSN), is an immensely popular application in China. In this paper we specifically focus on a popular WeChat sub-service, namely, the  service, which is exemplary of a  service, similar to those on Momo and Tinder. Specifically, the  service reads in the current geographic location of the device to locate a list of other people using WeChat who are in the same vicinity. The user can then request to establish a WeChat friendship relation with any of the users on the list. In this paper, we explore: (i) if one gender tends to use the  service more than another; (ii) if users of  are more anonymous than ordinary WeChat users; (iii) if ordinary WeChat users are more anonymous than Twitter users. We also take an in-depth examination of the user anonymity and demographics in a combined fashion and examine: (iv) if ordinary WeChat females are more anonymous than ordinary males; (v) if  females are more anonymous than  males. By answering these questions, we will gain significant insights into modern online dating and friendship creation, insights that should be able to inform sociologists as well as designers of future  services.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Location-based Social Network (LBSN) services enable people to discover users nearby and establish the communication with them. WeChat as both LBSN and Online Social Network (OSN) application does not impose a real-name policy for usernames, leaving the users to choose how they want to be identified by nearby people. In this paper, we show the feasibility to stalk WeChat users in any city from any place in the world and in parallel examine the anonymity of those users. Based on previous studies, we develop an automated attacking methodology by using fake GPS location, smart phone emulation, task automation, and optical character recognition (OCR). We then study the prevalence and behavior of Anonymous and Identifiable WeChat users and correlate their anonymity with their behavior, especially for those who repeatedly query the People Nearby service, a feature that triggers WeChat to discover nearby people. By monitoring Wall Street for 7 days, we gather location information relevant to 3,215 distinct users and finally find that Anonymous users are largely less inhibited to be dynamic participants, as they query more and are more willing to move around in public. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that quantifies the relationship between user mobility and user anonymity. We expect our study to motivate better privacy design in WeChat.',\n",

The objective of this present work was to study the short-term influence of enzymatic activity in validamycin treated soils. The results showed that high dose of validamycin introduced into soil had an significant effect on soil enzymatic activities, the degree of inhibition or promotion of enzymatic activities was not only related to the concentration of validamycin, but also to the remain time. Compared with the control (non treatment with validamycin), 240 ml.mg(-1) validamycin treatment caused a significant decrease (14%) of soil catalase activity; validamycin also inhibited urease activity to 67.3%, but subsequently, validamycin stimulated its activity higher than that of the control. Only the highest dose stimulated acid phophatase activities by 29.7%, and other concentration treatments had no effects on these enzymatic activities. The above results indicated that validamycin had effects on soil enzyme, but the effective time was short. It is also interesting to speculate that validamycin can be easily used by the soil microorganism as carbon source and energy.',\n",

In order to exploit cheap carbon source for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) production, alligator weed hydrolysates were prepared by acid and enzyme treatment and used for PHB production via Cupriavidus necator. The bacterium utilized alligator weed enzymatic hydrolysate and produced the PHB concentration of 3.8 +/- 0.2 g/L at the conditions of pH 7.0, 27.5 degrees C, 1.5 g/L of nitrogen source, and 25 g/L of carbon source, this exceeded the value of 2.1 +/- 0.1 g/L from acid hydrolysate media at the same conditions. In order to obtain the optimum conditions of PHB production, response surface methodology was employed which improved PHB content. The optimum conditions for PHB production are as follows: carbon source, 34 g/L; nitrogen source, 2 g/L; pH, 7; temperature, 28 degrees C. After 72 hr of incubation, the bacterium produced 8.5 g/L of dry cell weight and 4.8 g/L of PHB. The PHB was subjected to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Molecular weight analysis and found the melting temperature, number average molecular mass, and polydispersity were 168.20 degrees C, 185 kDa, and 2.1, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Heat-induced protein aggregation is important for the texture of various food products. Many types of food proteins have been found to assemble into fibrillar structures under certain conditions. We studied fibril formation of cottonseed 7S storage protein upon heating (for 0-720 min) at 90°C and pH 2.0, investigated the conversion rate, and determined the extent of thermal aggregation.Thioflavin-T fluorescence and Congo-red analysis indicated the formation of amyloid-like fibrils upon heating. Centrifugal filtration indicated that the conversion was very low (<10%) until congossypin concentration up to 2 mg mL(-1), and the conversion increases with increasing heating time, but levels off after longer heating times. Dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy showed that the extent of thermal aggregation at pH 2.0, or contour length of the worm-like and fine-stranded aggregates, progressively increased with increasing heating time. Furthermore, reducing electrophoresis analyses indicated that progressive polypeptide hydrolysis occurred upon heating. Experiments indicate that congossypin can form heat-induced amyloid-like aggregates and the conversion of congossypin monomers into fibrils increased with heating time and protein concentration.The results would be of vital importance for the utilisation of cottonseed proteins to produce thermally induced fibrillar gels with excellent properties.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Streptomycin is a common contaminant in a variety of industrial and agricultural wastewaters. The available information on the potential toxicity of streptomycin of fresh algae implicated in the treatment of biological wastewater is extremely limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of streptomycin on physiological indices and photosynthesis-related gene transcription. The results of short-term batch bioassays indicated that streptomycin was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than to green algae. The EC50 of streptomycin in Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella vulgaris were 0.28 and 20.08 mg L(-1) , respectively. These selected streptomycin concentrations inhibited algal cell growth and decreased chlorophyll or phycocyanobilin content. Streptomycin also destroyed the overall membrane system, which was speculated from malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage increasing after streptomycin exposure. Two algae were induced to increase their antioxidant enzyme activities to withstand streptomycin. However, the balance between oxidant substance and antioxidant enzyme was broken, because reactive oxygen species (ROS) content simultaneously increased. Streptomycin inhibited photosynthesis-related gene transcription in C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa. Transcript levels of psaB, psbA, and rbcL in C. vulgaris decreased to only 14.5%, 32.2%, and 9.3% of the control, respectively. Similarly, the transcript levels of psaB, psbD, and rbcL in M. aeruginosa decreased markedly in the present of streptomycin. The transcription of these genes was 12.4%, 26.1%, and 28.4% of the control after 0.1 mg L(-1) streptomycin exposure, respectively. Our results demonstrate that streptomycin is toxic to fresh algae, affects photosynthesis-related gene transcription, and blocks electron transport and ROS overproduction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The enantioselective effects of imazethapyr (IM) enantiomers on wheat seedlings in a hydroponic medium were studied. R-IM at 0.05mg/L exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on shoot weight and root weight than 0.05mg/L S-IM, suggesting that R-IM more severely inhibited growth. Oxidative damage, based on the anthocyanin content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, antioxidant enzyme activities and transcript levels of antioxidant enzyme genes, were studied together with the cellular ultrastructure of wheat leaves. The anthocyanin and MDA contents in the R-IM treatment group were significantly increased compared with those in the control group, but no significant changes were observed in the S-IM treatment group. The antioxidant enzyme activities of CAT and SOD were inhibited by 0.32- and 0.73-fold, respectively, in the 14day R-IM treatment group compared to those in the control. However, the transcript levels of antioxidant enzyme genes, including CuZnSOD, POD and CAT, were downregulated in the 14day R-IM exposure group, but those of DHAR were not. The number and size of starch granules increased and chloroplast swelling was observed in wheat leaf cells after R-IM exposure, which showed that photosynthetic functions were potentially disturbed. These results directly or indirectly imply that R-IM exposure causes more oxidative stress and exerts a stronger negative effect on wheat than S-IM. A metabolomics approach revealed that the tricarboxylic acid cycle was heavily suppressed by R-IM treatment. Some amino acids (proline, threonine, lysine, valine) were increased by only the R-IM treatment, indicating the activation of antioxidant pathways. The decrease in a series of fatty acids implied that the cell membrane composition changed in response to R-IM. These results provide a deeper understanding of the enantioselective effects of IM enantiomers on the molecular and metabolic responses in wheat seedlings.',\n",

We investigated the effects of a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) inhibitor, trilostane (TRI), and a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor antagonist, fipronil (FIP), on the HPG axis using an early life stage of the Japanese medaka. The newly hatched larvae were exposed to TRI (100, 300 and 1000 μg/L) and FIP (3, 10 and 30 μg/L), respectively, until 28 days post-hatching. Exposure to TRI decreased the body length in males, whereas FIP inhibited growth in both sexes. The induction of steroidogenesis-regulating genes (including 3β-hsd) in males exposed to TRI, accompanied by increased vtg and er transcription, indicating a compensatory response to the presumed 3β-HSD inhibition. These compensatory responses were not observed in TRI-treated females. Regarding FIP exposure, the GABA blocker resulted in the down-regulation of fshr and lhr. A compensatory up-regulation of steroidogenesis-regulating genes partially explained the elevated transcripts of vtg genes in both males and females after FIP exposure. These results suggest that both the inhibition of 3β-HSD and the antagonism of GABA receptors are relevant modes of endocrine disruption that could impact the normal regulation of the HPG axis.',\n",

However, we observed that their scheme cannot be applied in real world, for there are two defects in their scheme and the scheme doesn't satisfy with what they has claimed. The two drawbacks are: (1) not having an efficient verification algorithm (the signature almost cannot be verified for the exponent is too large).

       "  'abstract': 'Physico-chemical parameters, hydrological conditions, and microbial interactions can affect the growth and persistence of cyanobacteria, but the interacting effects among these bloom-forming factors are still poorly known. This hampers our capacity to predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom accurately. Here, we studied the relationship between temperature, N and P cycles, and the microbial community abundance and diversity at 0.5\\xa0m under the surface of West Lake (China) from January 21 to November 20, 2015, in order to better understand the key factors regulating temporal changes in the cyanobacterial community. Using high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region, we studied the diversity and abundance of bacteria. In parallel, we measured physico-chemical parameters and followed the abundance of key genes involved in N fixation, denitrification, and nutrient uptake. Multivariate analyses suggest that P concentration and water temperature are the key factors controlling the outbreak of summer cyanobacterial bloom. RT-qPCR analyses of the bacterial community and measurements of the copy number of denitrification-related gene (nirK, nosZ, nirS) show that denitrification potential and denitrifying bacteria relative abundance (Pseudomonas and Bacillus) increased in concert with diazotrophic cyanobacterial genera (Anabaena, Nostoc, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) and the common bloom-forming non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium genus Microcystis. The present study brings new insights on the complex interplay between physico-chemical parameters, heterotrophic bacterial community composition, nitrogen cycle, and cyanobacteria dominance in a eutrophic lake.',\n",

The variations of gluten protein in you-tiao were investigated in this study during frying, with a view toward a theoretical basis for the improvement of processing methods and quality in you-tiao. During the processing of you-tiao, gluten protein altered significantly. Analysis of secondary structure and surface hydrophobicity indicated that gluten protein molecules were unfolded and decomposed after frying, providing the opportunity for protein reaggregation. The extractability and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles demonstrated the decomposition and reaggregation of gluten protein. Analysis of the chemical interactions proved that gluten protein molecules aggregated mainly by disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Frying induced a loose and uneven gluten network.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Greater exposure to herbicide increases the likelihood of harmful effects in humans and the environment. Glufosinate, a non-selective herbicide, inhibits glutamine synthetase (GS) and thus blocks ammonium assimilation in plants. In the present study, the aquatic unicellular alga Chlorella vulgaris was chosen to assess the effects of acute glufosinate toxicity. We observed physiological changes during 12-96 h of exposure, and gene transcription during 6-48 h of exposure. Exposure to glufosinate increased malondialdehyde content by up to 2.73 times compared with the control, suggesting that there was some oxidative damage. Electron microscopy also showed that there were some chloroplast abnormalities in response to glufosinate. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) also increased markedly in the presence of glufosinate. Maximum activities of SOD, POD, and CAT were 2.90, 2.91, and 2.48 times that of the control, respectively. These elevated activities may help alleviate oxidative damage. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay showed changes in transcript abundances of three photosynthetic genes, psaB, psbC, and rbcL. The results showed that glufosinate reduced the transcript abundances of the three genes after 12h exposure. The lowest abundances of psaB, psbC and rbcL transcripts in response to glufosinate exposure were 38%, 16% and 43% of those of the control, respectively. Our results demonstrate that glufosinate affects the activities of antioxidant enzymes, disrupts chloroplast ultrastructure, and reduces transcription of photosynthesis-related genes in C. vulgaris.',\n",

Here we studied the toxicity and detoxification of AgNPs (and ionic silver released by the AgNPs) in a prokaryotic (Microcystis aeruginosa) and a eukaryotic (Chlorella vulgaris) freshwater phytoplankton species using a combination of proteomic, gene transcription, and physiological analyses. We show that AgNPs were more toxic to the growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant systems, and carbohydrate metabolism of M. aeruginosa than of C. vulgaris. C. vulgaris could detoxify efficiently AgNPs-induced ROS species via induction of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase or SOD, peroxidase or POD, catalase or CAT, and glutamine synthetase), allowing photosynthesis to continue unabated at growth-inhibitory AgNPs concentration. By contrast, the transcription and expression of SOD and POD in M. aeruginosa was inhibited by the same AgNPs exposure.

This arrangement does not take into account the frequencies of letters and digits when the users touch the buttons to key in their passwords or messages. We examine large scale datasets of over 141 million passwords collected from several leading websites for social networking, Internet forums, gaming, dating, and various other online service providers in China, and find that the distribution of letters in passwords is quite close to that in Chinese language. Based on the letter/digit frequencies, we further propose an alphanumeric button layout scheme with the following advantages: the buttons are clicked as uniformly as possible, so that the lifetime of the touchscreen can be prolonged and finger oil residues may scatter more evenly over the button area of the screen; and in the meantime, the movements of users' fingers are improved to enhance good user experience when inputting messages. The idea behind the layout is potentially applicable to diversified races.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the gradual ban on brominated flame retardants (FRs), the application of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has increased remarkably. Considering the structural similarity between OPFRs and organophosphate pesticides, hypotheses that OPFRs may interfere with neurodevelopment as organophosphate pesticides are reasonable. In this study, the neurotoxicity of three OPFRs, including tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), was evaluated in zebrafish larvae and then compared with the neurotoxicity of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). The results showed that similar to CPF, exposure to OPFRs for 5days resulted in significant changes in locomotor behavior, either in free swimming or in photomotor response. However, given the transcriptional changes that occur in nervous system genes in response to OPFRs and CPF, as well as the altered enzyme activity of AChE and its mRNA level, the underlying mechanisms for neurotoxicity among these organophosphate chemicals might be varied. In summary, the results confirm the potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of OPFRs and underscore the importance of identifying the mechanistic targets of the OPFRs with specific moieties. Furthermore, as the neurobehavioral responses are well conserved among vertebrates and the exposure of children to OPFRs is significant, a thorough assessment of the risk of OPFRs exposure during early development should be highly emphasized in future studies.

       "  'abstract': 'For public key encryption schemes, adaptive chosen ciphertext security is a widely accepted security notion since it captures a wide range of attacks. SAEP and SAEP+ are asymmetric encryption schemes which were proven to achieve semantic security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks. However, the bandwidth for message is essentially worse, that is the ciphertext expansion (the length difference between the ciphertext and the plaintext) is too large. In most of the mobile networks and bandwidth constrained communication systems, it is necessary to securely send as many messages as possible. In this article, we propose two chosen-ciphertext secure asymmetric encryption schemes. The first scheme is a generic asymmetric encryption padding scheme based on trapdoor permutations. The second one is its application to the Rabin-Williams function which has a very fast encryption algorithm. These asymmetric encryption schemes both achieve the optimal bandwidth w.r.t. the ciphertext expansion, namely with the smallest ciphertext expansion. Further, tight security reductions are shown to prove the security of these encryption schemes.',\n",

In this paper we propose to use for authentication Chinese characters, for which the entropy can be up to 9.65 (much larger than other languages). We first show an algorithmic framework to authenticate a user and then present an empirical analysis conducted at a university. The advantages of the framework include the following: the storage overhead is low; no personal experience or hand selection is involved; there is no predefined dictionary of likely choices; and it can be easily referenced by personal-style cues. Our study shows that the number of participants that prefer our framework is much close to that in favor of graphical passwords, with an interesting outcome that the two groups of participants present significantly distinct backgrounds. Our framework and graphical passwords can be used as candidate authentication methods for users with different backgrounds. We also measure user choices of patterns and find that there is a slight preference of the 3$\\\\\\\\times$3 grid to the circle patterns.

       "  'abstract': 'Bentazon is a widely used herbicide that selectively removes broad-leaf weeds by competing with plastoquinone for the binding site in the D1 protein and interrupting the PET (photosynthetic electron transfer) chain. However, monocotyledonous plants, such as rice, show strong resistance to bentazon due to CYP81A6 induction, which results in herbicide detoxification. Here, we confirmed that rice was sensitive to bentazon treatment during the initial exposure period, in which bentazon rapidly inhibited photosynthesis efficiency and electron transfer, based on results of chlorophyll fluorescence analysis. In order to gain a comprehensive, pathway-oriented, mechanistic understanding of the effects directly induced by bentazon, we employed 2D-DIGE (two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis) to analyze the leaf proteome after 8h of bentazon treatment coupled with individual protein identification by MALDI-TOF (Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) MS/MS. Proteomic analyses revealed that bentazon induced the relative upregulation or downregulation of 30 and 71 proteins (by 1.5-fold or more, p<0.05), respectively. The pathways involved include photosynthesis processes, carbohydrate metabolism, antioxidant systems, and DNA stabilization and protein folding. Protein analysis data revealed that bentazon primarily suppressed photosynthesis processes, and showed inhibitory effects on carbohydrate metabolism and ATP synthesis, whereas several stress response proteins were induced in response to bentazon. Importantly, we identified a 519kD protein containing two histidine kinase-like ATPase domains and a C3HC4 RING type zinc finger domain which may function as a transcript factor to drive expression of detoxification genes such as CYP81A6, leading to bentazon tolerance. This study identifies, for the first time, a candidate transcription factor that could up-regulate CYP81A6 expression, and provides a foundation for further research to advance our knowledge of mechanisms of bentazon resistance in rice.',\n",

However, traditional method message authentication code (MAC) employs a symmetric cryptographical technique and it needs to keep a shared private key between two parties. For convenience, people now begins to use public key techniques to provide message authentication. In wireless communication, we shall save more space for message itself because of the limited resources. Therefore, we believe that our proposed digital signature scheme will be more fitful for this kind of communication due to the following merits: (1) in addition to inheriting the merits of RSA signature such as high verification efficiency, the proposed scheme also shows its advantage over RSA by resisting low public key exponent attack; (2) comparing with 1024 bits RSA, our digital signature scheme can sign 2048-bit long message once, and generate a signature with 1025 bits length which doubles the capacity of the 1024-bit RSA signature; (3) the scheme is provably secure and its security is tightly related to the hardness of conic-based (CB)-RSA assumption.

       "  'abstract': 'An efficient multi-signature scheme secure in the random oracle model is proposed, which is the first multi-signature scheme with tight security reduction to the hardness of computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem. The scheme only needs the proof-of-possession (POP) key registration assumption to prevent the notorious rogue key attacks and obtain existentially unforgeable security against the adaptively chosen message and signing groupattack. Given current state of the art, it is as difficult to solve the CDH problem as it is to solve the DL problem in many groups of cryptographic interest. Thus the scheme with tight security reduction offers substantially better efficiency (for a given level of provable security) than other schemes in the discrete logarithm setting. Moreover, both the size of multi-signature and the computational cost of verification do not increase with the number of actual signers increasing. Therefore, the proposed scheme is efficient and can be conveniently implemented in the current public key infrastructure (PKI) environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the marine wireless sensor networks, marine sensors collect multidimensional data such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll concentration in the ocean using a single hardware unit for further statistical analysis. Once these data are collected, they will be sent to the satellites or vessels for scientific information processing purposes, e.g. computing the mean, the variance and making regression analysis. Verifiable computation (VC) always allows the computationally weak parties to execute computing function operations over outsourced data sets or perform data sets towards outsourced functions to the cloud and still provides an efficient way to verify the returned result, which is an important issue in marine wireless sensor networks. However, the oceangoing voyage vessels always have low computational abilities, in such a way that they may outsource some computations (that need expensive computation costs by themselves) to the data center on the land (e.g. cloud). The computational results cannot be used directly since the cloud may return an incorrect outcome for some profits. Hence, we design a secure publicly VC protocol called ({mathcal {DM}}{-}{mathcal {PVC}}), which supports both public delegation and public verifiability properties and tackles outsourced functions and outsourced data sets in a combined way. We additionally prove the proposed ({mathcal {DM}}{-}{mathcal {PVC}}) secure in the random oracle model and evaluate its performance in the end.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Copper nanoparticles (nCu) are widely used in industry and in daily life, due to their unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. Few studies have focused on nCu phytotoxicity, especially with regard to toxicity mechanisms in crop plants. The present study examined the effect of 15.6\\u202fμM nCu exposure on the root morphology, physiology, and gene transcription levels of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a major crop cultivated worldwide. The results obtained were compared with the effects of exposing wheat to an equivalent molar concentration of ionic Cu (Cu released from CuSO) and to control plants. The relative growth rate of roots decreased to approximately 60% and the formation of lateral roots was stimulated under nCu exposure, possibly due to the enhancement of nitrogen uptake and accumulation of auxin in lateral roots. The expression of four of the genes involved in the positive regulation of cell proliferation and negative regulation of programmed cell death decreased to 50% in the Cu treatment compared to that of the control, while only one gene was down-regulated to about half of the control in nCu treatment. This explained the decreased root cell proliferation and higher extent of induced cell death in Cu- than in nCu-exposed plants. The increased methane dicarboxylic aldehyde accumulation (2.17-fold increase compared with the control) and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities (more than 50% decrease compared with the control) observed in the Cu treatment in relation to the nCu treatment indicated higher oxidative stress in Cu- than in nCu-exposed plants. Antioxidant (e.g., proline) synthesis was pronouncedly induced by nCu to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species, alleviating phytotoxicity to wheat exposed to this form of Cu. Overall, oxidative stress and root growth inhibition were the main causes of nCu toxicity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diclofop-methyl (DM) is a widely used chiral herbicide, which rapidly hydrolyzes to its major metabolite diclofop acid (DC) after application. With a carbon chiral center, DC not only is an important ingredient of herbicidal activity, but also has a long half-life in soil. Studies so far have only considered the activity of racemic DM in target organisms, and the enantioselective toxicity in nontarget plants of DM and DC has yet to be explored. In this study, the enantioselective phytotoxicity of DC mediated by oxidative stress and the key enzyme ACCase in the fatty acid synthesis system on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. Significant differences between the two enantiomers were observed in phytotoxicity including growth inhibition, oxidative damage and alteration of key genes expression of ACCase, with R-DC showing greater toxicity to Arabidopsis thaliana than S-DC. The results of molecular docking showed that there was a stronger affinity between R-DC and the target enzyme carboxyltransferase domain of ACCase, likely leading to the enantioselective phytotoxicity of DC. This study suggested that chirality of both parent compounds and metabolites should be considered to improve our understanding of the environmental fate and risks of chiral pesticides.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Three ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia (Wild type, Wt) and two mutants (pgr5 and ndf4), were used to evaluate the effects of diuron on photosynthetic activity of A. thaliana. It was found that diuron adversely affected the fresh weight and chlorophyll content of the plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence studies determined that the pgr5 mutant was more sensitive to diuron than Wt and the ndf4 mutant. Gene expression analysis revealed different roles for the two cyclic electron transfer (CET) pathways, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) and proton gradient regulation (PGR5) pathways, in the plant after diuron treatment. For example, a gene in the NDH pathway, lhca5, was activated in the low dose (LD) group in the pgr5 mutant, but was down-regulated in the moderate dose (MD) group, along with two other NDH-related genes (ppl2 and ndhH). In the PGR5 pathway, the pgr5 gene was functional under conditions of increased stress (MD group), and was up-regulated to a greater extent in the ndf4 mutant than that in the Wt and pgr5 mutant. Our results suggest that the PGR5 pathway in plants is more important than the NDH pathway during resistance to environmental stress. Deficiencies in the PGR5 pathway could not be counteracted by the NDH pathway, but deficiencies in the NDH pathway could be overcome by stimulating PGR5.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A multisignature scheme allows an ad hoc set of users to sign a message so that the resulting single signature certifies that the users endorsed the message. However, all known multisignatures are either at the price of complexity and additional trust of Certificate Authority (CA), or sacrificing efficiency of computation and communication (including both bandwidth and round). This paper proposes a new multisignature scheme with efficient verification in the plain public key model. Our multisignatures enjoys the most desired features: (1) Our plain public key model-based multisignatures do not impose any impractical key setup or PKI requirements; (2) Our multisignature scheme is non-interactive, which saves computation and communication in signature generation; (3) Through pre-computation, our scheme achieves O(1) verification in the plain public key model; (4) Provable tighter security under the standard CDH assumption ensures high level of security in both practice and theory. Hence, our non-interactive multisignatures are of great use in authentication of routes in networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Accurate and efficient thermal analysis for a VLSI chip is crucial, both for sign-off reliability verification and for design-time circuit optimization. To determine an accurate temperature profile, it is important to simulate a die together with its thermal mounts: this requires solving Poisson's equation on a nonrectangular 3D domain. This article presents a class of eigendecomposition-based Fast Poisson Solvers (FPS) for chip-level thermal analysis. We start with a solver that solves a rectangular 3D domain with mixed boundary conditions in O(N⋅ logN) time, where N is the dimension of the finite difference matrix. Then we reveal, for the first time in the literature, a strong relation between fast Poisson solvers and Green-function-based methods. Finally, we propose an FPS method that leverages the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve nonrectangular 3D domains efficiently. We demonstrate this approach on thermal analysis of an industrial microprocessor, showing accurate results verified by a commercial tool, and that it solves a system of dimension 4.54e6 in only 13 conjugate gradient iterations, with a runtime of 65 seconds, a 15X speedup over the popular ICCG solver.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many previous studies have reported the role of oat β-glucan (OBG) in the reduction of postprandial glucose, and hypothesised that OBG may form a protective layer along the intestinal wall, acting as a viscous barrier to decrease glucose transportation. This study examined whether the molecular weight (MW) and concentration of OBG affected the diffusion of glucose in vitro. The effect of OBG on glucose transportation in vitro and sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase) activity in the everted small intestines of normal rats was also examined.In vitro, higher MWs and concentrations of OBG, increased the inhibitory effects on glucose diffusion and glucose adsorption. The transport of glucose by glucose transporters and Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity in the small intestinal mucosa of rats were significantly lower following the addition of OBG than those in the absence of OBG at the same time-points throughout glucose transportation (P < 0.05). In the OBG-treated group, the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity decreased with increasing OBG MW. However, as the concentration of OBG in the solution increased, the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity in the small intestine increased due to stronger gastrointestinal motility. We also found that higher MWs of OBG had a greater inhibitory effect on intestinal disaccharidase activities in vitro.Oat β-glucan is able to adsorb glucose molecules, inhibit glucose transport, decrease the concentration of available glucose and suppress disaccharidase activities in the small intestine.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ciprofloxacin (CIP), one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in water systems, has become an aquatic contaminant because of improper disposal and excretion by humans and animals. It is still unknown how trace amounts of CIP affect the aquatic microbial community diversity and function. We therefore investigated the effects of CIP on the structure and function of freshwater microbial communities via 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing and metatranscriptomic analyses. CIP treatment (7\\u202fμg/L) did not significantly alter the physical and chemical condition of the water body as well as the composition of the main species in the community, but slightly increased the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and decreased the relative abundance of eukaryotes. Metatranscriptomic results showed that bacteria enhanced their phosphorus transport and photosynthesis after CIP exposure. The replication, transcription, translation and cell proliferation were all suppressed in eukaryotes, while the bacteria were not affected in any of these aspects. This interesting phenomenon was the exact opposite to both the antibacterial property of CIP and its safety for eukaryotes. We hypothesize that reciprocal and antagonistic interactions in the microcosm both contribute to this result: cyanobacteria may enhance their tolerance to CIP through benefiting from cross-feeding and some secreted substances that withstand bacterial CIP stress would also affect eukaryotic growth. The present study thus indicates that a detailed assessment of the aquatic ecotoxicity of CIP is essential, as the effects of CIP are much more complicated in microbial communities than in monocultures. CIP will continue to be an environmental contaminant due to its wide usage and production and more attention should be given to the negative effects of antibiotics as well as other bioactive pollutants on aquatic environments.',\n",

During this process,  accumulated several intermediates in energy metabolism pathways to provide energy for its sustaining high growth rates, and increased intracellular sugars to enhance its competitive capacity and ability to defend itself against microbial attack. It also produced a variety of toxic substances, including microcystins, to inhibit metabolite formation via energy metabolism pathways of aquatic microorganisms, leading to a negative effect on bacterial and eukaryotic microbial richness and diversity. Overall, compared with the monoculture system, the growth of  was accelerated in coculture, while the growth of some cooccurring microorganisms was inhibited; with the diversity and richness of eukaryotic microorganisms being more negatively impacted than prokaryotic microorganisms.

This study we measure the microbial community composition and metabolic responses of  in a microcosms coculture system receiving dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIP) close to the average concentrations in Lake Taihu.

Furthermore,  can decrease carbohydrate metabolism of cooccurring aquatic microorganisms and thus disrupt microbial activities in the coculture. This also had a negative effect on bacterial and eukaryotic microbial richness and diversity. Microcystin was capable of decreasing the biomass of total phytoplankton in aquatic microcosms.

This report investigated the enantioselectivity between R- and S-IM in rice and explored its causative mechanism at the physiological and molecular levels. The results suggested that R-IM inhibited acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity to a greater extent than S-IM, which reduced the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Additionally, most other amino acids showed enantioselectivity. On the cellular level, R-IM showed stronger toxicity against protoplasts than S-IM. A gene transcription profile analysis showed that gene transcripts in many metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis, starch and sugar metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle displayed enantioselectivity between the IM enantiomers. R-IM regulated more genes more strongly than S-IM. This study suggested that R-IM has stronger toxicity against plants than S-IM; this toxicity is caused not only by changing targeted enzyme activity and amino acid synthesis, but also by affecting gene transcription in other metabolic pathways directly or indirectly in an enantioselective manner.',\n",

In the present study, the rheological properties and thermal properties were combined to investigate the effects of protein on mechanical and inner structure changes of rice kernel during cooking. The morphologic changes in overall form and inner structure of the kernel showed the limited and uneven gelatinization of starch, and reflected the good heating stability of protein. The comparison of molecular mobility in HO/DO reflected the special gelatinization behavior of starch and the hydrophobicity of protein during cooking. The similar proton distributions between starch, starch-protein mixture and rice flour indicated the weak interactions between starch and protein.

We followed an array of cellular functions and biomolecules in C. vulgaris cells exposed to 50 or 100 μM Cr at three different initial NH4 (+) concentrations (0.5, 3, and 10 mM). The results showed that Cr strongly inhibited cell yield of C. vulgaris, but 10 mM NH4 (+) could decrease by more than two-fold Cr toxicity on cell yield compared to exposure to 0.5 mM NH4 (+). Cr toxicity on gene transcripts and cellular substructure was also much lower at high than at low NH4 (+). Our results suggest that this protecting effect of NH4 (+) on intracellular Cr toxicity could be due to several factors, such as enhance uptake of phosphorus, increase in C and N assimilation efficiency, and increase transcription of photosynthesis-related genes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In order to make people truly benefit from data sharing, we need technical solutions to assuring the trustworthiness of data received from parties one may not have encountered in the past. Assured data provenance is an important means for this purpose because it (i) allows data providers to get credited for their contribution or sharing of data, (ii) is able to hold the data providers accountable for the data they contributed, and (iii) enables the data providers to supply high-quality data in a self-healing fashion. While the above (i) and (ii) have been investigated to some extent, the above (iii) is a new perspective that, to our knowledge, has not been investigated in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a novel cryptographic technique that can simultaneously offer these properties. Our technique is called editable signatures, which allow a user, Bob, to edit (e.g., replace, modify, and insert) some portions of the message that is contributed and signed by Alice such that the resulting edited message is jointly signed by Alice and Bob in some fashion. While it is easy to see that the above (i) and (ii) are achieved, the above (iii) is also achieved because Bob may have a better knowledge of the situation that allows him to provide more accurate/trustworthy information than Alice, who may intentionally or unintentionally enter inaccurate or even misleading data into an information network. This is useful because Alice\\'s inaccurate or even misleading information will never be released into an information network if it can be ``cleaned\" or \"healed\" by Bob. Specifically, we propose two novel cryptographic constructions that can be used to realize the above functions in some practical settings.',\n",

This study clarifies the mechanism of nCuO toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings via comparison with copper (Cu) ion bioeffects. Under the same culture conditions, Cu(2+) ion exposure exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on plant fresh weight and growth and caused stronger oxidative disruption (measured by malondialdehyde, MDA) than nCuO exposure. The Cu(2+) ions also showed a stronger induction effect than did nCuO on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the transcription of antioxidant-related genes. Dissolved Cu(2+) ions contributed a minority of the toxicity of nCuO, implying that nCuO itself showed relative strong phytotoxicity.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper investigates the link selection policy for secure communications over a buffer-aided two-hop communication link. It is assumed that a source wishes to send information to a destination with the aid of a trusted half-duplex relay node compromised by a passive eavesdropper, and that there is no direct link between the source and the destination. The buffer-aided relay forwards the information to the destination by employing the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme. Both the source and the relay transmissions are assumed to be vulnerable to the eavesdropper. The perfect channel side information (CSI) of the network is assumed to be available at the source and the relay. A link selection policy with on/off power control that both the source and the relay transmit with fixed transmission power levels is derived. It is shown to achieve near-optimal performance as the average transmission power levels at both the source and the relay approach to infinity. A low complexity and asymptotically optimal on/off power control joint link selection is then proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed link selection policy with on/off power control can achieve superior performance over constant power link selection policies. Overall, the impact of on/off power control on the performance of buffer-aided secure communication over two-hop systems is characterized.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With ever-shrinking device geometries, process variations play an increased role in determining the delay of a digital circuit. Under such variations, a gate may lie on the critical path of a manufactured die with a certain probability, called the criticality probability. In this paper, we present a new technique to compute the statistical criticality information in a digital circuit under process variations by linearly traversing the edges in its timing graph and dividing it into \"zones.\" We investigate the sources of error in using tightness probabilities for criticality computation with Clark\\'s statistical maximum formulation. The errors are dealt with using a new clustering-based pruning algorithm which greatly reduces the size of circuit-level cutsets improving both accuracy and runtime over the current state of the art. On large benchmark circuits, our clustering algorithm gives about a 250× speedup compared with a pairwise pruning strategy with similar accuracy in results. Coupled with a localized sampling technique, errors are reduced to around 5% of Monte Carlo simulations with large speedups in runtime.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diclofop-methyl (DM), a common post-emergence herbicide, is frequently used in agricultural production. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are one of the most widely used nanoparticles, and as such, have been detected and monitored in several environmental systems. Here we investigated the interactive effects of DM and AgNPs on the physiological morphology, photosynthesis and antioxidant system of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrated that a 1.0\\xa0mg/L DM treatment had no significant effect on the fresh weight of plant shoots and the content of total chlorophyll and anthocyanin. However, a 0.5\\xa0mg/L AgNPs treatment was found to significantly inhibit plant growth and chlorophyll synthesis, and was found to cause more severe oxidative damage in plants compared to the effects observed in a hydroponic suspension in which DM and AgNPs were jointly present. Meanwhile, the relative transcript levels of photosynthesis related genes (psbA, rbcL, pgrl1A and pgrl1B) in the combined group were found to be slightly increased compared to transcript levels in the AgNPs group, in order to maintain ATP generation at relatively normal levels in order to repair light damage. One explanation for these observed antagonistic effects was that the existence of DM affects the stability of AgNPs and reduced Ag release from AgNPs in the mixed solution. Thereupon, the Ag-content was found to decrease in shoots and roots in the combined group by 15.2% and 9.4% respectively, compared to the AgNPs group. The coexistence of herbicides and nanomaterials in aquatic environments or soil systems will continue to exist due to their wide usages. Our current study highlights that the antagonistic effects between DM and AgNPs exerted a positive impact on A.\\xa0thaliana growth.',\n",

Here, we studied Ag uptake mechanisms in the prokaryotic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa exposed to AgNPs by measuring growth inhibition in the absence or presence of high-affinity Ag-binding ligands and by genetic transformation of E. coli with a protein predicted to be involved in Ag uptake. We discovered a new von Willebrand A (vWA) domain-containing protein in M. aeruginosa that mediates Ag uptake from AgNPs when expressed in E. coli. This new Ag transport protein, which is absent in eukaryotic algae, is a potential candidate explaining the higher AgNPs toxicity in cyanobacteria such as M. aeruginosa than that in eukaryotic algae.

       "  'abstract': 'Given the critical role of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, it is conceivable that perturbations at any point along this axis can potentially affect reproduction in fish and other vertebrates. We investigated the effects of a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) inhibitor, trilostane (TRI), and a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor antagonist, fipronil (FIP), on the HPG axis using an early life stage of the Japanese medaka. The newly hatched larvae were exposed to TRI (100, 300 and 1000\\xa0μg/L) and FIP (3, 10 and 30\\xa0μg/L), respectively, until 28\\xa0days post-hatching. Exposure to TRI decreased the body length in males, whereas FIP inhibited growth in both sexes. The induction of steroidogenesis-regulating genes (including -) in males exposed to TRI, accompanied by increased  and  transcription, indicating a compensatory response to the presumed 3β-HSD inhibition. These compensatory responses were not observed in TRI-treated females. Regarding FIP exposure, the GABA blocker resulted in the down-regulation of  and . A compensatory up-regulation of steroidogenesis-regulating genes partially explained the elevated transcripts of  genes in both males and females after FIP exposure. These results suggest that both the inhibition of 3-HSD and the antagonism of GABA receptors are relevant modes of endocrine disruption that could impact the normal regulation of the HPG axis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper presents a new stochastic preconditioning approach for large sparse matrices. For the class of matrices that are rowwise and columnwise irreducibly diagonally dominant, we prove that an incomplete $\\\\rm{LDL^T}$ factorization in a symmetric case or an incomplete LDU factorization in an asymmetric case can be obtained from random walks and used as a preconditioner. It is argued that our factor matrices have better quality, i.e., better accuracy-size trade-offs, than preconditioners produced by existing incomplete factorization methods. Therefore a resulting preconditioned Krylov-subspace iterative solver requires less computation than traditional methods to solve a set of linear equations with the same error tolerance. The advantage increases for larger and denser matrices. These claims are verified by numerical tests, and we provide techniques that can potentially extend the theory to non-diagonally-dominant matrices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diclofop-methyl (DM), a widely used herbicide in food crops, may partly contaminate the soil surface of natural ecosystems in agricultural area and exert toxic effects at low dose to nontarget plants. Even though rhizosphere microorganisms strongly interact with root cells, little is known regarding their potential modulating effect on herbicide toxicity in plants. Here we exposed rice seedlings (Xiushui 63) to 100μg/L DM for 2 to 8days and studied the effects of DM on rice rhizosphere microorganisms, rice systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and rice-microorganisms interactions. The results of metagenomic 16S rDNA Illumina tags show that DM increases bacterial biomass and affects their community structure in the rice rhizosphere. After DM treatment, the relative abundance of the bacterium genera Massilia and Anderseniella increased the most relative to the control. In parallel, malate and oxalate exudation by rice roots increased, potentially acting as a carbon source for several rhizosphere bacteria. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that DM induced SAR in rice seedlings through the salicylic acid (but not the jasmonic acid) signal pathway. This response to DM stress conferred resistance to infection by a pathogenic bacterium, but was not influenced by the presence of bacteria in the rhizosphere since SAR transcripts did not change significantly in xenic and axenic plant roots exposed to DM. The present study provides new insights on the response of rice and its associated microorganisms to DM stress.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Gliadins are major allergens responsible for wheat allergies. Food processing is an effective strategy to reduce the allergenicity of gluten. In the present study, we determined secondary and tertiary structure of gliadins treated with chemical, physical and enzymatic treatments through FTIR, surface hydrophobicity, intrinsic fluorescence spectrum and UV absorption spectrum. The results showed that the three treatments of phosphorylation, alcalase and papain hydrolysis significantly changed the conformational structures of gliadins, especially the secondary structure. Then, the potential allergenicity of the phosphorylated, alcalase and papain hydrolyzed gliadins were further characterized, and we observed a significant decrease in the allergenicity through the results of the index of spleen, serum total IgE, gliadin-specific IgE, histamine and serum cytokines concentrations. An elevation of Th17 cells, the absence of Treg cells, and an imbalance in Treg/Th17 are associated with allergy. Based on the expression levels of related cytokines and key transcription factors, we also confirmed that phosphorylation, alcalase and papain hydrolysis could effectively reduce the allergenicity of gliadins by improving the imbalance of both Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 in the spleens of sensitized mice. This study suggested that the changes of conformational structure contribute to gliadins hyposensitization, phosphorylation, alcalase and papain hydrolysis may be promising strategies for production of wheat products with low allergenicity.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Effects of 17α‑ethinylestradiol on caudal fin regeneration in zebrafish larvae.',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"The ability to restore tissue function and morphology after injury is a key advantage of many fish for a greater chance of survival. The tissue regeneration process is regulated by multiple pathways, and it can therefore be hypothesized that environmental contaminants targeting components of these signaling pathways, may disrupt the fish's capability to repair or regenerate. This could lead to higher mortality and eventually even to a decline in populations. In this study, the effects of 17α‑ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen, were assessed on the regenerative capacity of larval zebrafish. Zebrafish aged 2\\u202fhour post fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 1, 10, or 100\\u202fng/L EE2, and the caudal fins were amputated at 72\\u202fhpf. It was found that EE2 exposure significantly inhibited fin regeneration and changed locomotor behavior. The transcription levels for most of the genes involved in the signaling networks regulating the fin regeneration, such as axin2, fgfr1, bmp2b and igf2b, were down-regulated in the amputated fish in response to EE2 exposure, which was in contrast to their increased patterns in the vehicle-exposed control fish. Additionally, the mRNA levels of several immune-related genes, such as il-1β, il-6, il-10 and nf-κb2, were significantly decreased after EE2 exposure, accompanied by a lower density of neutrophils migrated into the wound site. In conclusion, the present study indicated for the first time that estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EEDCs) could inhibit the regenerative capacity of zebrafish, and this effect was speculated to be mediated through the alteration in regeneration-related signaling pathways and immune competence. This work expands our knowledge of the potential effects of EEDCs on injured aquatic organisms, and highlights the ecotoxicological significance of relationships between regenerative process and endocrine system. This study also implies the potential application of fin regeneration assay for assessing immunotoxicity in ecotoxicological risk assessment.\",\n",

The sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (S-AOM) process catalyzed by ANaerobic MEthanotrophic (ANME) archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is a vital link connecting the global carbon and sulfur cycles, and it is considered to be the overriding methane sink in marine ecosystem. However, there have been few studies regarding the role of S-AOM process and the distribution of ANME archaea in intertidal ecosystem. Intertidal zone is a buffer zone between sea and land, and plays an important role in global geochemical cycle. In this work, the abundance, potential methane oxidation rate and community structure of ANME archaea in the intertidal zone were studied by quantitative PCR, stable isotope tracing method and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the potential S-AOM activity ranged from 0 to 0.77 nmol CO g (dry sediment) day The copy number of 16S rRNA gene of ANME archaea reached 10 ∼ 10 copies g (dry sediment). The average contribution of S-AOM to total anaerobic methane oxidation was up to 34.5% while denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation accounted for the rest, which implied that S-AOM process was an essential methane sink that cannot be overlooked in intertidal ecosystem. The simulated column experiments also indicated that ANME archaea were sensitive to oxygen and preferred anaerobic environmental conditions. This work will help us gain a better understanding of the global carbon-sulfur cycle and greenhouse gas emission reduction, and introduce a new perspective into the enrichment of ANME archaea.

       "  'abstract': 'The enantiomers of a chiral compound possess different biological activities, and one of the enantiomers usually shows a higher level of toxicity. Therefore, the exploration of the causative mechanism of enantioselective toxicity is regarded as one of primary goals of biological chemistry. Imazethapyr (IM) is an acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting chiral herbicide that has been widely used in recent years with racemate. We investigated the enantioselectivity between R- and S-IM to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to regulate antioxidant gene transcription and enzyme activity.Dramatic differences between the enantiomers were observed: the enantiomer of R-IM powerfully induced ROS formation, yet drastically reduced antioxidant gene transcription and enzyme activity, which led to an oxidative stress. The mechanism by which IM affects carbohydrate metabolism in chloroplasts has long remained a mystery. Here we report evidence that enantioselectivity also exists in starch metabolism. The enantiomer of R-IM resulted in the accumulation of glucose, maltose and sucrose in the cytoplasm or the chloroplast and disturbed carbohydrates utilization.The study suggests that R-IM more strongly retarded plant growth than S-IM not only by acting on ALS, but also by causing an imbalance in the antioxidant system and the disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism with enantioselective manner.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The risk presented by β-blockers on aquatic organisms remains uncertain, particularly given the enantiospecific differences in toxicity of chiral β-blockers. In this study, the toxicity of two β-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol, was determined. The 96-h LC50 of propranolol in the zebrafish larvae was 2.48 mg/L, whereas 50 mg/L metoprolol did not result in death. Both β-blockers decreased the heart rate and hatching rate and increased the mortality of the zebrafish embryos. Among these indicators, the heart rate was the most sensitive. However, the acute larval and embryo toxicity results displayed no enantioselectivity. Additionally, the transcriptional response of the genes encoding the β-adrenergic receptors and those involved in other physiological processes, including the antioxidant response, detoxification, and apoptosis, in zebrafish larvae exposed to the β-blockers was examined. Although the changes in gene transcription were fairly minor, significant enantioselectivity was observed for β-blockers, suggesting that the transcriptional response was more sensitive for the evaluation of enantiospecific toxicity. Based on these results, the pharmaceutical drugs were not expected to pose a risk to fish; however, this conclusion should not be considered final. These results also demonstrated that the enantiospecific toxicity of chiral β-blockers should be investigated when performing an ecological risk assessment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   Chiral herbicides are often used in agriculture as racemic mixtures, although studies have shown that the fate and toxicity of herbicide enantiomers to target and non-target plants can be enantioselective and that herbicide toxicity can be mediated by only one enantiomer. If one enantiomer is active against the target plant, the use of enantiomer-rich herbicide mixtures instead of racemic herbicides could decrease the amount of herbicide applied to a crop and the cost of herbicide application, as well as unintended toxic herbicide effects in the environment. Such a change in the management of herbicide applications requires in-depth knowledge and a critical analysis of the fate and effects of herbicide enantiomers in the environment. This review article first synthesizes the current state of knowledge on soil and plant biodegradation of herbicide enantiomers. Second, we discuss our understanding of the biochemical toxicity mechanisms associated with both enantiomers in target and non-target plants gained from state-of-the-art genomic, proteomic and metabolomic tools. Third, we present the emerging view on the “side effects” of herbicides in the root microbiome and their repercussions on target or non-target plant metabolism. Although our review of the literature indicates that the toxicity of herbicide enantiomers is highly variable depending on plant species and herbicides, we found general trends in the enantioselective toxic effects of different herbicides in vascular plants and algae. The present study will be helpful for pesticide risk assessments as well as for the management of applying enriched-enantiomer herbicides.',\n",

Moreover, the richness of the microbial communities temporarily decreased during this process, while their diversity remained uninfluenced by treatment with nPS. Although the three tested nPS types were found to disturb the compositions of both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities to some degree, they did not affect the functions of freshwater bacterial communities significantly due to functional redundancy.

       "  'abstract': 'Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used because of their excellent antibacterial properties. They are, however, easily discharged into the water environment, causing potential adverse environmental effects. Meta-transcriptomic analyses are helpful to study the transcriptional response of prokaryotic and eukaryotic aquatic microorganisms to AgNPs. In the present study, microcosms were used to investigate the toxicity of AgNPs to a natural aquatic microbial community. It was found that a 7-day exposure to 10\\xa0μg\\xa0L silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) dramatically affected the structure of the microbial community. Aquatic micro eukaryota (including eukaryotic algae, fungi, and zooplankton) and bacteria (i.e., heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria) responded differently to the AgNPs stress. Meta-transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that eukaryota could use multiple cellular strategies to cope with AgNPs stress, such as enhancing nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, over-expressing genes related to translation, amino acids biosynthesis, and promoting bacterial-eukaryotic algae interactions. By contrast, bacteria were negatively affected by AgNPs with less signs of detoxification than in case of eukaryota; various pathways related to energy metabolism, DNA replication and genetic repair were seriously inhibited by AgNPs. As a result, eukaryotic algae (mainly Chlorophyta) dominated over cyanobacteria in the AgNPs treated microcosms over the 7-d exposure. The present study helps to understand the effects of AgNPs on aquatic microorganisms and provides insights into the contrasting AgNPs toxicity in eukaryota and bacteria.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   Public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) is a special kind of public encryption scheme (PKE) that allows a tester to perform equality tests on ciphertexts generated by different public keys as well as the same public key. This feature enables us to apply PKEET to various scenarios in practice, such as efficient data management on encrypted databases and spam filtering in encrypted email systems. From these reasons, since Yang et al.  [1]  first proposed the concept of PKEET, there have been proposed many PKEET schemes to improve efficiency or to enhance functionalities. However, to the best of our knowledge, almost all existing schemes were presented under assuming the existence of random oracles, except for generic construction proposed by Lee et al. On the other hand, their generic approach for PKEET employs a 2-level hierarchical identity-based encryption and a strongly unforgeable one-time signature, which suffers from low efficiency.  In this paper, we propose an efficient PKEET scheme under a specific cryptographic assumption in the standard model. To this end, we first encrypt a message and its hash value in a parallel way by following the recently proposed strategy. Then, to prevent adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA2), we give a link between them by adapting the technique which was originally proposed for identity-based encryption and previously exploited to design efficient CCA2-secure PKE schemes. We show that our proposed construction satisfies formal security requirements for PKEET under the decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption in the standard model. As a result, we obtain a new PKEET scheme which has shorter ciphertext and trapdoor sizes, and improves computational costs for encryption, decryption, and test algorithms, by about 60%, 77%, and 66%, respectively, compared to a PKEET instantiation obtained by the prior generic framework.',\n",

However, IM spraying can lead to the accumulation of herbicide residues in leaves. Here, we determined the effects of IM spraying on the plant growth and leaf surface microbial communities of Arabidopsis thaliana after 7 and 14\\u202fdays of exposure. The results suggested that IM spraying inhibited plant growth. Fresh weight decreased to 48% and 26% of the control value after 7 and 14\\u202fdays, respectively, of 0.035\\u202fkg/ha IM exposure. In addition, anthocyanin content increased 9.2-fold and 37.2-fold relative to the control content after 7 and 14\\u202fdays of treatment, respectively. Furthermore, IM spraying destroyed the cell structures of the leaves, as evidenced by increases in the number of starch granules and the stomatal closure rate. Reductions in photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant enzyme activity were observed after IM spraying, especially after 14\\u202fdays of exposure. The diversity and evenness of the leaf microbiota were not affected by IM treatment, but the composition of community structure at the genus level was altered by IM spraying. Imazethapyr application increased the abundance of Pseudomonas, a genus that includes species pathogenic to plants and humans, indicating that IM potentially increased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria on leaves. Our findings increase our understanding of the relationships between herbicide application and the microbial community structures on plant leaves, and they provide a new perspective for studying the ecological safety of herbicide usage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The first CCA secure public key encryption (PKE) on the learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption was invented by Dottling et al. (ASIACRYPT 2012). At PKC 2014, Kiltz et al. gave a simpler and more efficient construction, where a double-trapdoor technique was introduced to handle the decryption queries in game simulation. Different from the technique, we build in the standard model the CCA secure PKE on a variant of Extended Knapsack LPN problem (which is provably equivalent to the standard LPN problem). We abstract out an ephemeral key from the LPN assumption, which can then be used to encrypt the underlying plaintext when equipped with several typical classes of cryptographic primitives. Thanks to these techniques, the decryption queries can be correctly answered (yet without relying on a double-trapdoor mechanism) during security reduction from LPN. The resulting simple proposal appears more modular and efficient.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing demand for and production of commercial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) inevitably increases the risk for their environmental release and soil accumulation, which could have deleterious effects on plant growth and soil microorganism communities. However, to date, little is known about how AgNPs impact plant growth, seed quality, and soil microbial communities. We therefore evaluated wheat growth and seed quality after exposure to low concentration of AgNPs while characterizing the composition of the associated soil microbial community by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Our results showed that low concentration of AgNPs (1\\xa0mg/kg in fresh soil) neither inhibited wheat seedling growth nor changed the amino acid content in wheat seeds. Interestingly, the soil microorganisms in the wheat-planted group had more diversity and richness than those in the bulk-soil group. The structure of the bacterial community was affected by AgNP exposure, most significantly during the transition from the seedling to the vegetative stage of the wheat, but recovered to normal level after 49\\xa0days of treatment. In conclusion, the results from this study highlight that the environmental risks associated with low concentration of AgNPs, which have clear bioeffects on soil microorganisms, warrant further investigation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The use of pesticides to ensure global food security is the most important pest control strategy in modern agriculture but causes extensive soil pollution. This pollution involves potential risks to human health and ecosystems. In addition to soil animal growth, the adverse impact of pesticides on the gut microbiomes of nontarget soil fauna remains largely unknown. Here, the effect of the fungicide azoxystrobin (AZ) on soil and the gut microbiota of soil animals (Enchytraeus crypticus) was studied. The tested concentrations of AZ altered the bacterial community in the soil and E. crypticus gut and were slightly toxic with respect to E. crypticus adult mortality and reproduction. The most abundant bacterial phylum, Proteobacteria, significantly increased in response to the 2 and 5\\u202fmg/kg AZ treatments, which implied a disordered unhealthy gut bacterial community. Furthermore, bacterial community analysis between the soil and gut showed that the main effect of AZ on the gut microbiota was directly through AZ, not soil microbiota. In addition, AZ exposure significantly enhanced the number and total abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the E. crypticus gut; these genes may enter the soil food web to affect higher trophic levels and cause a more serious ecological risk. Our study reported the effect of pesticides on the gut of soil animals and on the enrichment of ARGs as global emerging contaminants, revealing unknown potential impacts of fungicides on ecosystem services and sustainable food production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The top-selling strobilurin, azoxystrobin (AZ), is a broad-spectrum fungicide that protects against many kinds of pathogenic fungi by preventing their ATP production. The extensive use of AZ can have negative consequences on non-target species and its effects and toxic mechanisms on algae are still poorly understood. In this work, Chlorella pyrenoidosa that had been grown in BG-11 medium was exposed to AZ (0.5-10 mg L-1) for 10 d. The physiological and molecular responses of the algae to AZ treatment, including photosynthetic efficiency, lipid peroxidation level, antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as transcriptome-based analysis of gene expression, were examined to investigate the potential toxic mechanism. Results shows that the photosynthetic pigment (per cell) increased slightly after AZ treatments, indicating that the photosystem of C. pyrenoidosa may have been strengthened. Glutathione and ascorbate contents were increased, and antioxidant enzyme activities were induced to relieve oxidative damage (e.g., from lipid peroxidation) in algae after AZ treatment. Transcriptome-based analysis of gene expression combined with physiological verification suggested that the 5 mg L-1 AZ treatment did not inhibit ATP generation in C. pyrenoidosa, but did significantly alter amino acid metabolism, especially in aspartate- and glutamine-related reactions. Moreover, perturbation of ascorbate synthesis, fat acid metabolism, and RNA translation was also observed, suggesting that AZ inhibits algal cell growth through multiple pathways. The identification of AZ-responsive genes in the eukaryotic alga C. pyrenoidosa provides new insight into AZ stress responses in a non-target organism.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Remediation of metal-contaminated soils and waters using nanoparticles is highly limited by their strong tendency to aggregate in soil solution and natural water. In order to enhance the remediation of Hg0-contaminated soil solution and groundwater by Se nanoparticles (SeNPs), the effects of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the stability of SeNPs and Hg0 removal were investigated. EPS from the selenite-reducing bacterium Citrobacter freundii Y9 were found to make SeNPs more negatively charged by strong adsorption, which significantly enhanced the stability of SeNPs. The protein, carboxylate, polysaccharide and lipid components of the EPS were involved in the adsorption to SeNPs. Fluorescence quenching titration measurements implied that the binding of proteinaceous substances in the EPS to SeNPs was static quenching. EPS can therefore enhance the remediation efficiency of SeNPs for soil solution and groundwater contaminated with Hg0. This study highlights that bacterial EPS can be used as an effective natural dispersant for SeNPs, therefore improving the efficiency of mercury immobilization in contaminated waters.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Linoleic acid (LA), is the product of secondary metabolism secreted from Microcystis aeruginosa, and it exhibits allelopathic activity against eukaryotic algae. However, information about on the mechanisms associated with the inhibition of algal activity by LA is limited. In this study, Chlorella pyrenoidosa was treated with LA (20-120\\u202fμg\\u202fL) for 4\\u202fdays, and its growth inhibition and physiological responses were examined for potential toxic mechanisms. The photosynthetic efficiency of C. pyrenoidosa was inhibited by LA treatments, and the F/F parameter decreased significantly compared to that of controls; however, the photosynthetic pigment content did not change significantly. Peroxidase activity was enhanced, relieving oxidative damage in algae after LA treatments. However, superoxide dismutase and catalase were suppressed, ultimately leading to the aggravation of lipid peroxidation. Transcriptome-based gene expression analysis revealed that the 120\\u202fμg\\u202fL LA treatment significantly inhibited the transcription of genes related to photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and amino acid metabolism in C. pyrenoidosa, suggesting that these genes might be key LA targets in C. pyrenoidosa. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in vitamin, lipid, nitrogen cycling, terpenoid, and ascorbate metabolism was also affected, suggesting that LA inhibits algal cell growth through multiple pathways. The identification of LA-responsive genes in C. pyrenoidosa provides new insight into LA stress responses in eukaryotic algae.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   The Location-Based Services (LBS) enables people to find location places according to their interests. As the size of LBS dataset surprisingly increases, the LBS providers inevitably outsource their LBS dataset to a cloud server, but needs to encrypt it at first for preventing sensitive information leakage. However, designing a scheme that supports generic LBS query over encrypted data is still a challenging problem. Motivated by this, we present a practical privacy-preserving generic LBS query scheme (     P    3    GQ   ), which achieves both data privacy and query privacy. In the scheme, a LBS provider outsources its dataset to a cloud server and relies on it to process LBS queries, but leaks no confidential information about both the dataset and queries to the cloud server. More specifically, we introduce a new tool called    CircleTest   : to test whether a point is inside of a given circular area or not, while keeps them secret. Hence, we obtain the      P    3    GQ    scheme to support for generic LBS query while achieving privacy-preserving based on the    CircleTest    building block and an encrypted inverted index technique. We analyze the privacy requirements of our scheme, and additionally conduct an experiment on both the building block    CircleTest    and the      P    3    GQ    scheme to show their practical performance.',\n",

Measurements of the copy number of denitrification-related genes and 16S rRNA analyses show that denitrification potential and denitrifying bacteria abundance increased in concert with non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp.), suggesting limited competition between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers for nutrients, although potential bacteria-mediated N loss may hamper Microcystis growth.

However, nAlO toxicity mechanisms and potential beneficial effects on terrestrial plant physiology remain poorly understood. Such knowledge is essential for the development of robust nAlO risk assessment. In this study, we studied the influence of a 10-d exposure to a total selected concentration of 98\\xa0μM nAlO or to the equivalent molar concentration of ionic Al (AlCl) (196\\xa0μM) on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana on the physiology (e.g., growth and photosynthesis, membrane damage) and the transcriptome using a high throughput state-of-the-art technology, RNA-seq. We found no evidence of nAlO toxicity on photosynthesis, growth and lipid peroxidation. Rather the nAlO treatment stimulated root weight and length by 48% and 39%, respectively as well as photosynthesis opening up the door to the use of nAlO in biotechnology and nano agriculture. Transcriptomic analyses indicate that the beneficial effect of nAlO was related to an increase in the transcription of several genes involved in root growth as well as in root nutrient uptake (e.g., up-regulation of the root hair-specific gene family and root development genes, POLARIS protein). By contrast, the ionic Al treatment decreased shoot and root weight of Arabidopsis thaliana by 57.01% and 45.15%, respectively. This toxic effect was coupled to a range of response at the gene transcription level including increase transcription of antioxidant-related genes and transcription of genes involved in plant defense response to pathogens. This work provides an integrated understanding at the molecular and physiological level of the effects of nAlO and ionic Al in Arabidopsis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) regulates the intracellular folates pool for DNA synthesis and methylation. Sequence variations in MTHFR (nucleotides 677 (C&RARR; T) and 1298 (A&RARR; C)) result in allozymes with decreased activity. The 677TT genotype is associated with increased toxicity of methotrexate and increased clinical response to 5-fluorouracil in treatment of cancers including breast cancer. We evaluated MTHFR genotypes and breast cancer survival in a cohort of 1067 Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 1998 who received surgery and chemotherapy. Life table method was used to calculate 5-year survival rates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Median follow-up time was 5.2 years; 5-year survival was 84.6%. Sixty-six percent carried a 677T allele and 31% carried a 1298 C allele. We found that overall 5-year breast cancer survival did not differ significantly across all genotypes (85.3% for 677 CC and 83.8% for 677TT; 83.8% for 1298 AA and 79.1% for 1298 CC). However, carrying the 677T allele was associated with non-significant increased risk of death for subjects with late stage disease (stages III-IV) (HR=1.80, 95% CI: 0.79-4.14 for TT vs. CC, p for trend=0.15), particularly among those who had survived past the second year (HR=2.97, 95% CI: 1.10-7.98, p for trend=0.04). The A1298C genotypes were not significantly associated with risk of death. This study suggests that the MTHFR C677T polymorphisms may affect long-term survival from advanced breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Phthalate esters are man-made chemicals commonly used as plasticizers and solvents, and humans may be exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption. Little is known about predictors of phthalate exposure, particularly in Asian countries. Because phthalates are rapidly metabolized and excreted from the body following exposure, it is important to evaluate whether phthalate metabolites measured at a single point in time can reliably rank exposures to phthalates over a period of time. We examined the concentrations and predictors of phthalate metabolite concentrations among 50 middle-aged women and 50 men from two Shanghai cohorts, enrolled in 1997–2000 and 2002–2006, respectively. We assessed the reproducibility of urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in three spot samples per participant taken several years apart (mean interval between first and third sample was 7.5years [women] or 2.9years [men]), using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and intra-class correlation coefficients. We detected ten phthalate metabolites in at least 50% of individuals for two or more samples. Participant sex, age, menopausal status, education, income, body mass index, consumption of bottled water, recent intake of medication, and time of day of collection of the urine sample were associated with concentrations of certain phthalate metabolites. The reproducibility of an individual's urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites across several years was low, with all intra-class correlation coefficients and most Spearman rank correlation coefficients ≤0.3. Only mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, had a Spearman rank correlation coefficient ≥0.4 among men, suggesting moderate reproducibility. These findings suggest that a single spot urine sample is not sufficient to rank exposures to phthalates over several years in an adult urban Chinese population.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Little information is available regarding association of depressive symptoms (DS) with cancer and chronic diseases among middle-aged and elderly Chinese in a population-based setting. In this study we evaluated the prevalence and examined correlates of DS in two population-based cohort studies. Included in the analyses were 103,595 people with a mean age of 61.8 years at the DS assessment. The prevalence of DS was 2.4% in men and 5.6% in women. We found elderly participants, those with lower BMI, or chronic diseases were more likely to experience DS. Having a history of stroke (odds ratio (OR)\\u2009=\\u20092.2 in men and 1.8 in women), cancer (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.3 in men and 1.9 in women), or Parkinson's disease (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.1 in men and 2.7 in women) was associated with high DS. In women, high income and high education levels were inversely related to DS. Being a single woman, long-term or heavy female smoker was associated with high prevalence of DS. High BMI was correlated with low prevalence of depression in men. Our data suggests a low prevalence of DS among middle-aged and elderly people in Shanghai, China. Age, education, income, marital status, smoking, BMI, and certain health conditions were associated with DS.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Sleep disorder is highly prevalent among breast cancer patients. Whether sleep disorder is associated with breast cancer prognosis has rarely been investigated. The objective of this study is to prospectively assess the association of self-reported sleep difficulty and sleep quality with total mortality and breast-cancer specific mortality/recurrence in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study.  Methods: This study included 4,219 women with stage I-III breast cancer diagnosed at an age between 20 to 75 years. Information on sleep attributes was collected at approximately 18 months and 36 months after breast cancer diagnosis. Information on disease recurrence and survival status was obtained via in-person follow-up and via record linkage with vital statistics registry data. Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality/recurrence. Stratified analyses according to self-reported overall quality of life, depression and energy level assessed at 18 months were also conducted.  Results: During a median follow-up of 9.8 years (range: 0.1-12.2 years), 757 deaths due to any causes and 672 breast cancer recurrences or related deaths were recorded after the 18-month post-diagnosis survey. Sleep difficulty and low sleep quality were not significantly associated with total or breast-cancer specific mortality/recurrence. The respective HRs were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.22) and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.31) for total mortality and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.31) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.26) for breast cancer-specific mortality/recurrence. On the other hand, low quality of life, depression and low energy level were significantly associated with increased total mortality, with HRs of 3.19 (2.45, 4.15), 1.61 (1.21, 2.14) and 1.53 (1.23, 1.91), respectively. These three factors did not modify the association of sleep measurements with breast cancer outcomes (all P-interactions u003e 0.10).  Conclusions: In a large population-based cohort study, we did not observe any significant association of sleep difficulty and poor sleep quality with increased risk of death and recurrence in breast cancer patients. Instead, low quality of life and energy level were found to be associated with disease prognosis and thus they could be important indicators for targeting population with poor breast cancer prognosis.

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) belongs to active peptide, which is an effective mitogenic factor. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of bFGF on proliferation and differentiation of monkey bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) into neuronal precursor cells. METHODS: Monkey BMMSCs were in vitro cultured by density gradient centrifugation, and then divided into 4 groups after passaged, namely, control, bFGF with low, medium and high concentration groups. In the bFGF groups, 0, 3, 6, 10 μg/L bFGF were applied. The proliferation of BMMSCs in each group were observed. The 5th BMMSCs were cultured with serum free L-DMEM culture medium containing 20 mg/L cryptotanshinone to differentiated into neural-like cells. The expression of positive-nestin protein was detected by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Compared with the control group, proliferation rate of BMMSCs in the bFGF groups were accelerated (P < 0.05), which showed a positive correlation to the concentration of bFGF. The positive-nestin protein could be found in the low and medium concentration groups at 0.5 hours after induction, and reached a peak at 1.5 hours, which increased obviously in the low concentration group than that of the high concentration group (P < 0.05). bFGF can promote BMMSCs proliferation in vitro, enhance inducing ratio of prophase neuron-like cells at lower concentration but inhibit differentiation at high level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Objectives: Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) antagonise each other in (re)absorption, inflammation and many other physiological activities. Based on mathematical estimation, the absorbed number of Ca or Mg depends on the dietary ratio of Ca to Mg intake. We hypothesise that the dietary Ca/Mg ratio modifies the effects of Ca and Mg on mortality due to gastrointestinal tract cancer and, perhaps, mortality due to diseases occurring in other organs or systems. Design: Prospective studies. Setting: Population-based cohort studies (The Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Shanghai Men's Health Study) conducted in Shanghai, China. Participants: 74 942 Chinese women aged 40-70 years and 61 500 Chinese men aged 40-74 years participated in the study. Primary outcome measures: All-cause mortality and disease-specific mortality. Results: In this Chinese population with a low Ca/Mg intake ratio (a median of 1.7 vs around 3.0 in US populations), intakes of Mg greater than US Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) levels (320 mg/day among women and 420 mg/day among men) were related to increased risks of total mortality for both women and men. Consistent with our hypothesis, the Ca/Mg intake ratio significantly modified the associations of intakes of Ca and Mg with mortality risk, whereas no significant interactions between Ca and Mg in relation to outcome were found. The associations differed by gender. Among men with a Ca/Mg ratio >1.7, increased intakes of Ca and Mg were associated with reduced risks of total mortality, and mortality due to coronary heart diseases. In the same group, intake of Ca was associated with a reduced risk of mortality due to cancer. Among women with a Ca/Mg ratio ≤1.7, intake of Mg was associated with increased risks of total mortality, and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancer. Conclusions: These results, if confirmed, may help to understand the optimal balance between Ca and Mg in the aetiology and prevention of these common diseases and reduction in mortality.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Data from three large prospective cohort studies and a meta-analysis did not support that oral health plays a major role in the development of colorectal cancer.While studies have shown that poor oral health status may increase the risk of cancer, evidence of a specific association with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is inconclusive. We evaluated the association between oral health and CRC risk using data from three large cohorts: the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS), the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), and the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), and carried out a meta-analysis of results from other relevant published studies. This study applied a nested case-control study design and included 825 cases/3298 controls from the SMHS/SWHS and 238 cases/2258 controls from the SCCS. The association between oral health status (i.e. tooth loss/tooth decay) and CRC risk was assessed using conditional logistic regression models. A meta-analysis was carried out based on results from the present study and three published studies. We found that tooth loss was not associated with increased risk of CRC. ORs and respective 95% CIs associated with loss of 1-5, 6-10, and > 10 teeth compared with those with full teeth are 0.87 (0.69-1.10), 0.93 (0.70-1.24), and 0.85 (0.66-1.11) among SMHS/SWHS participants; and 1.13 (0.72-1.79), 0.87 (0.52-1.43), and 1.00 (0.63-1.58) for those with loss of 1-4, 5-10, and > 10 teeth among SCCS participants. Data regarding tooth decay were available in the SCCS, but were not associated with CRC risk. Meta-analysis confirmed the null association between tooth loss/periodontal disease and CRC risk (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86-1.29). In this analysis of three cohorts and a meta-analysis, we found no evidence supporting an association between oral health and CRC risk.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'At the turn of this century, Herbert Kroemer, the 2000 Nobel Prize winner in Physics, famously commented that “the interface is the device”. This statement has since opened up unparalleled opportunities at the interface of conventional three-dimensional (3D) materials (H. Kroemer, Quasi-Electric and Quasi-Magnetic Fields in Non-Uniform Semiconductors, RCA Rev., 1957, 18, 332–342). More than a decade later, Sir Andre Geim and Irina Grigorieva presented their views on 2D heterojunctions which further cultivated broad interests in the 2D materials field. Currently, advances in two-dimensional (2D) materials enable us to deposit layered materials that are only one or few unit-cells in thickness to construct sharp in-plane and out-of-plane interfaces between dissimilar materials, and to be able to fabricate novel devices using these cutting-edge techniques. The interface alone, which traditionally dominated overall device performance, thus has now become the device itself. Fueled by recent progress in atomically thin materials, we are now at the ultimate limit of interface physics, which brings to us new and exciting opportunities, with equally demanding challenges. This paper endeavors to provide stalwarts and newcomers a perspective on recent advances in synthesis, fundamentals, applications, and future prospects of a large variety of heterojunctions of atomically thin materials.',\n",

Methods Thirty-six SD male rats were randomized into sham operation group,model group,and captopril group.The model rats were established by pressure overload.RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of α-MHC and β-MHC in myocardial tissues. Results The α-MHC mRNA expression in left ventricular myocardial tissue was lower in model group than that in sham operation group (P<0.05).The α-MHC mRNA expression in captopril group was higher than that in model group (P<0.05). The β-MHC mRNA expression of left ventricular myocardial tissue was higher in model group than that in sham operation group (P<0.05). The β-MHC mRNA expression was lower in captopril group than that in model group (P<0.05). Conclusion Captopril could increase the expression of α-MHC and decrease the expression of β-MHC,which may be one of mechanisms for regression of myocardial hypertrophy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The effects of diet on breast cancer are controversial and whether the effects vary with hormone receptor status has not been well investigated. This study evaluated the associations of dietary factors with risk for breast cancer overall and by the hormone receptor status of tumors among Chinese women. The Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a large, population-based, case-control study, enrolled 3,443 cases and 3,474 controls in 1996-1998 (phase I) and 2002-2005 (phase II); 2676 cases had estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) data. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated, quantitative, food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived from multivariate, polychotomous, unconditional logistic regression models. Total vegetable intake was inversely related to breast cancer risk, with an adjusted OR for the highest quintile of 0.80 (95% CI = 0.67-0.95; P trend = 0.02). Reduced risk was also related to high intake of allium vegetables (P trend = 0.01) and fresh legumes (P trend = 0.0008). High intake of citrus fruits and rosaceae fruits were inversely associated with breast cancer risk (P trend = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively), although no consistent association was seen for total fruit intake. Elevated risk was observed for all types of meat and fish intake (all P trend < 0.05), whereas intakes of eggs and milk were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (both P trend <0.05). There was little evidence that associations with dietary intakes varied across the 4 tumor subtypes or between ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- tumors (P for heterogeneity >0.05). Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, whereas high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Soy and some of its constituents, such as isoflavones, have been shown to affect the inflammatory process in animal studies. The association between soy food intake and inflammatory markers has not been evaluated adequately in humans. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate whether higher intake of soy foods was inversely associated with inflammatory markers in 1,005 middle-aged Chinese women. Design: In this cross-sectional study, dietary intake of soy foods was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire and by a 24-hour recall when biospecimens were procured. A general linear model was used to estimate the geometric means of selected inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), soluble IL-6 receptor, soluble GP130, soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2, and C-reactive protein, across categories of soy food intake after adjusting for age, lifestyle and dietary factors, and history of infectious or inflammation-related diseases. Results: We found that multivariable-adjusted geometric mean concentrations of IL-6 and TNFα were inversely associated with quintiles of soy food intake, with a difference between the highest and lowest quintiles of 25.5% for IL-6 (P for trend=0.008) and 14% for TNFα (P for trend=0.04). Similar inverse associations were found for TNFα (P for trend =0.003), soluble TNF receptor 1 (P for trend=0.01), soluble TNF receptor 2 (P for trend=0.02), IL-1β (P for trend=0.05), and IL-6 (P for trend=0.04) when soy food consumption was assessed by the frequency of consumption in the preceding 24 hours. No significant associations were found for other markers studied. Conclusions: This study suggests that soy food consumption is related to lower circulating levels of IL-6, TNFα, and soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2 in Chinese women. © 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.',\n",

Little information, however, is available regarding the intra-individual variation of circulating miRNA levels.Methods: We measured expression levels of a panel of 800 miRNAs in repeated plasma samples from 51 healthy individuals that were collected 6 to 12months apart and evaluated the intra-individual variation by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).Results: After background correction, a total of 185 miRNAs were detected in at least 10% of the plasma samples, with 69 and 28 miRNAs being detected in 50% and 90% of samples, respectively. The median ICC was 0.46 for these 185 miRNAs. Among them, 41% (75 miRNAs) had an ICC0.5, and 23% (42 miRNAs) had an ICC0.6. The ICC is higher for miRNAs with higher expression levels or higher detection rates, when compared to those with lower expression levels or lower detection rates.Conclusions: These results suggest that common circulating miRNAs are stable over a relatively long period and can serve as reliable biomarkers for epidemiological and clinical research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective:To observe the effects of captopril on level of left ventricular myocardial tissue local angiotensin Ⅱ in rat with pressure overload and study the possible mechanism of regressing left ventricular remodeling. Method:Calculated left ventricular mass index by a validated formula:left ventricular mass index = left ventricular mass/body weight,light microscope and electron microscope were used to observe the left ventricular myocardium histopathological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and left ventricular myocytes ultramicrostructure respectively,radioimmunoassay was used to detect left ventricular myocardial tissue local angiotensin Ⅱ(AngⅡ).Results:The LVMI and AngⅡ level of left ventricular myocardial tissue in model group were higher than that of sham operation group (P<0.01). In captopril group,the LVMI and AngⅡ level were lower than that in model group(P<0.01). Under light microscope,HE staining of cardiac muscle in sham group:the size and form were normal,the fibers lined up in order,while there were great different in model group:the diameter of cardiac cells were increased; the fibers of interstitial tissue were in a great mess. HE staining of captopril was same to those of sham group. The left ventricular myocytes ultramicrostructure of sham group were eumorphism,while there were great different in model group:the chondrosome appear to degeneration,such as crista mitochondriales decreased,fracture,the density of stroma is thinner,sarcoplasmic reticulum is expanding; myofibrillar degeneration such as:the myofibril break,confused,the brink of cell nucleus irregularity,chromatin move to verge. The left ventricular myocytes ultramicrostructure of captopril were similar to that of sham group. Conclusion:Captopril had effects on regressing left ventricular remodeling which maybe concerned with the decrease of left ventricular myocardial tissue local AngⅡ level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Although dietary patterns, specific foods, and their constituents have been linked to cancer risk, the role of dietary patterns and specific food groups in liver cancer risk has not been investigated. In the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) and Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS), two cohort studies of 132837 Chinese women and men, we evaluated the relationship between dietary patterns, food groups, and liver cancer risk. Through in-person interviews, dietary information intake over the preceding year was collected by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals with adjustment for potential confounders. During an average follow-up of 10.9 (SWHS) or 5.5 (SMHS) years, 267 incident liver cancer cases were identified after the first 2years of study enrolment. Three dietary patterns were derived by factor analysis. A vegetable-based dietary pattern was inversely associated with liver cancer; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the lowest to highest quartiles were: 1.00; 0.98 (0.71-1.35); 0.93 (0.67-1.29); and 0.58 (0.40-0.84); P-trend=0.01. The association was stronger among participants with a history of chronic liver disease. Further analyses showed high intakes of celery, mushrooms, allium vegetables, composite vegetables (including asparagus lettuce and garland chrysanthemum), legumes and legume products were associated with reduced liver cancer risk (all P-trend<0.05). Fruit- and meat-based dietary patterns were not associated with liver cancer risk. Our study suggests that a vegetable-based dietary pattern is associated with reduced liver cancer risk.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Leisure-time physical activity (LPA) has been associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the potential effect of other types of physical activity on type 2 diabetes is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of occupational, commuting, daily living, and LPA on the incidence of type 2 diabetes in a cohort of middle-aged women.We prospectively followed 70,658 women who had no prior history of diabetes at study recruitment for 4.6 years. Participants completed in-person interviews at baseline that collected information on diabetes risk factors including physical activity habits. Anthropometric measurements were taken by trained interviewers. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by levels of occupational, commuting, daily living, and LPA.We documented 1973 incident cases of diabetes during 326,625 person-years of follow-up. LPA and daily living physical activity (DPA) were associated with a moderately reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risk for type 2 diabetes associated with LPA and DPA categories were 1.00, 0.89, 1.05, and 0.83, (P trend = 0.12) and 1.00, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.88, (P trend = 0.06) respectively. LPA was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in employed participants (P trend = 0.09) while DPA was mainly associated with a reduction in risk in non-employed participants (P trend <0.01). While occupational physical activity was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk in this population, commuting to work was associated with a reduction in risk. A combination of DPA and LPA was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.This study suggests that physical activity, either from leisure-time exercise or daily activity reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes in women, supporting the current health promotion efforts encouraging both exercise and non-exercise activity levels.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Introduction: Kidney stone risk factors are understudied among Asians. Our study objective was to investigate associations of obesity and other chronic diseases with incident kidney stones among the urban Chinese. Patients and Methods: Included in this study are two prospective cohorts: the Shanghai Women's Health Study (N=69,166) and Shanghai Men's Health Study (N=58,054). Incident kidney stones were determined by self-report in 2004 and 2008. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations of study variables with stone risk with adjustment of demographics, medical history, and dietary intakes. Results: There were 2653 incident stones over 1,007,958 person-years of follow-up. Overall incidence rates (per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI]) were 2.10 (1.99, 2.21) among women and 3.80 (3.59, 4.02) among men. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with risk (BMI 25 vs 18.5-24.9kg/m(2), women: hazard ratio [HR]=1.14 [95% CI 1.01, 1.28]; men: HR=1.17 [1.03, 1.32]). High waist-hip ratio (0.80 and 0.90 for women and men, respectively) was associated with risk (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01, 1.27 for women; HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05, 1.35 for men). Coronary heart disease or stroke history was associated with risk in women only (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10, 1.56). Hypertension history was associated with risk in men only (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11, 1.45). No significant association with diabetes mellitus was observed. Conclusions: Among the Chinese, kidney stone incidence in men is almost twice that of women. Obesity is a shared risk factor. Hypertension history is associated with risk in men, whereas history of coronary heart disease or stroke is associated with risk in women.\",\n",

Monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction was applied to measure relative telomere length.Telomere length was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, weight, and hip circumference (Ptrend = 0.005, 0.004, 0.004, 0.010, and 0.026, respectively), but not waist-to-hip ratio (Ptrend = 0.116) or height (Ptrend = 0.675). Weight change since age 50 was further evaluated among women over age 55. Women who maintained their weight within ±5% since age 50, particularly within a normal range (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) ), or reduced their weight from overweight (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m(2) ) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) ) to normal range, had a longer mean of current telomere length than women who gained weight since age 50 (Ptrend = 0.025), particularly those who stayed in obesity or gained weight from normal range or overweight to obesity (P = 0.023).Our findings show that telomere shortening is associated with obesity and that maintaining body weight within a normal range helps maintain telomere length.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Studies have found that tea polyphenols inhibit aromatase. Because of the substantial difference in levels of estrogens between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, the relationship between tea consumption and breast cancer risk may depend on menopausal status. METHODS: We examined this hypothesis in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a population-based cohort study of 74,942 Chinese women. RESULTS: We found a time-dependent interaction between green tea consumption and age of breast cancer onset (p for interaction, 0.03). In comparison with non-tea drinkers, women who started tea-drinking at 25 years of age or younger had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-1.17) to develop premenopausal breast cancer. On the other hand, compared with non-tea drinkers, women who started tea drinking at 25 years of age or younger had an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer with an HR of 1.61 (95% Cl: 1.18-2.20). Additional analyses suggest regularly drinking green tea may delay the onset of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to confirm our findings. Ann Epidemiol 2010;20:74-81.

       "  'abstract': 'More than 40 genetic susceptibility loci have been reported for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recently, the combined effect of genetic variants has been investigated by calculating a genetic risk score. We evaluated 36 genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified SNPs in 2,679 T2D cases and 3322 controls in middle-age Han Chinese. Fourteen SNPs were significantly associated with T2D in analysis adjusted for age, sex and BMI. We calculated two genetic risk scores (GRS) (GRS1 with all the 36 SNPs and GRS2 with the 14 SNPs significantly associated with T2D). The odds ratio for T2D with each GRS point (per risk allele) was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.06-1.09) for GRS1 and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13-1.18) for GRS2. The OR for quintiles were 1.00, 1.26, 1.69, 1.95 and 2.18 (P<0.0001) for GRS1 and 1.00, 1.33, 1.60, 2.03 and 2.80 (P<0.001) for GRS2. Participants in the higher tertile of GRS1 and the higher BMI category had a higher risk of T2D compared to those on the lower tertiles of the GRS1 and of BMI (OR = 11.08; 95% CI: 7.39-16.62). We found similar results when we investigated joint effects between GRS1 and WHR terciles and exercise participation. We finally investigated the joint effect between tertiles of GRSs and a composite high risk score (no exercise participation and high BMI and WHR) on T2D risk. We found that compared to participants with low GRS1 and no high risk factors for T2D, those with high GRS1 and three high risk factors had a higher risk of T2D (OR = 13.06; 95% CI: 8.65-19.72) but the interaction factor was of marginal significance. The association was accentuated when we repeated analysis with the GRS2. In conclusion we found an association between GRS and lifestyle factors, alone and in combination, contributed to the risk of and T2D among middle age Chinese.',\n",

The role of genetic variants in BCL-2 genes and their interactions with non-genetic factors in the development of endometrial cancer has not been investigated in epidemiological studies.We examined the relationship between BCL-2 gene family variants and endometrial cancer risk among 1,028 patients and 1,922 age-matched community controls from Shanghai, China. We also investigated possible interactions between genetic variants and established risk factors (demographic, lifestyle and clinical). Individuals were genotyped for 86 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BCL2, BAX, BAD and BAK1 genes.Significant associations with endometrial cancer risk were found for 9 SNPs in the BCL2 gene (P trend<0.05 for all). For SNPs rs17759659 and rs7243091 (minor allele for both: G), the associations were independent. The odds ratio was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.04-1.53) for women with AG genotype for the SNP rs17759659 and 1.82 (95% CI: 1.21-2.73) for women with the GG genotype for the SNP rs7243091. No interaction between these two SNPs and established non-genetic risk factors of endometrial cancer was noticed.Genetic polymorphisms in the BCL2 gene may be associated with the risk of endometrial cancer in Chinese women.',\n",

The novel UPFC structure has been applied in the Nanjing UPFC project, where the shunt converter is connected to a 35 kV bus, while two series converters are installed on two 220 kV lines. In this paper, the equivalent model of the novel UPFC is analyzed. Then a load flow method is proposed based on the power injection model and Newton-Raphson algorithm. The method can deal with the UPFC of both the novel structure and the conventional structure. The feasibility of the method is validated by test cases of the modified 39-bus New England system. The results show that the iteration number is acceptable under various operation conditions.',\n",

Methods: Ablation at lower zone is customarily applied in AVNRT,if noneffective,ablation electrode can be gradually moved upward,and radiofrequency energy can be delivered at a midpoint or upper position of His Bundle even with small H waves.The movement of the ablation electrode must be carefully monitored lest His bundle be eroded mistakenly.For those both atrioventricular nodal dual pathways(AVNDP) and atrioventricular accessory pathways(AVAP) are present,we always ablate AVAP first. Results: All 68 common AVNRT cases are simple slow-fast type.Among the 9 cases of refractory AVNRT,2 cases were combined with concealed left postseptal AVAP and concealed right AVAP respectively,while 1 case with atrioventricular nodal three pathways. Conclusion: X-ray anatomical position and intraventricular local mapping should be analyzed for the use of RFCA in refractory AVNRT.Safe and effective mapping should be: small A wave and big V wave,shattered A wave with width≥68 ms,A/V= 0.1-0.25,no H or H≤(0.02±0.03) mV.If lower position and middle position method are noneffective,linear ablation at mid-level of Koch's triangle seems to be a satisfactory alternative,which could avoid complications of atrioventricular block in the upper position ablation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Antioxidants may protect normal cells from the oxidative damage that occurs during radiotherapy and certain chemotherapy regimens; however, the same mechanism could protect tumor cells and potentially reduce effectiveness of cancer treatments. We evaluated the association of vitamin supplement use in the first 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis and during cancer treatment with total mortality and recurrence. Methods: We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study of 4,877 women aged 20 to 75 years diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Shanghai, China, between March 2002 and April 2006. Women were interviewed approximately 6 months after diagnosis and followed up by in-person interviews and record linkage with the vital statistics registry. Results: During a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 444 deaths and 532 recurrences occurred. Vitamin use shortly after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with reduced mortality and recurrence risk, adjusted for multiple lifestyle factors, sociodemographics, and known clinical prognostic factors. Women who used antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, multivitamins) had 18% reduced mortality risk (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.65-1.02) and 22% reduced recurrence risk (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63-0.95). The inverse association was found regardless of whether vitamin use was concurrent or nonconcurrent with chemotherapy, but was present only among patients who did not receive radiotherapy. Conclusions: Vitamin supplement use in the first 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis may be associated with reduced risk of mortality and recurrence. Impact: Our results do not support the current recommendation that breast cancer patients should avoid use of vitamin supplements. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(2); 262-71. (C)2010 AACR.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The association of obesity on survival among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been well characterized. We investigated the association of pre-diagnostic body mass index (BMI)/waist-hip ratio (WHR) and total/cause-specific mortality in CRC patients. This study included 1,452 patients who participated in two large cohort studies and were diagnosed with CRC during follow-up period. Participants were measured for anthropometrics and interviewed to collect relevant information at baseline, prior to any cancer diagnosis. Data on site-specific cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality were obtained via in-person surveys and annual record linkage with cancer and vital statistics registries. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations of BMI and WHR with survival. A total of 547 participants died during the follow-up period, including 499 who died of CRC. Relative to normal BMI (18.5 to\\u2009<\\u200925.0 kg/m(2) ), obesity (BMI\\u2009≥\\u200930 kg/m(2) ) was associated with increased mortality resulting from all causes (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.1-2.1) and CRC (HR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1). Elevated risk of death was also found among underweight patients (BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) ), although not all risk estimates were statistically significant. Overweight BMI (25.0 to\\u2009<\\u200930.0 kg/m(2) ) was not associated with risk of death among CRC patients, nor was WHR. In conclusion, pre-diagnostic BMI was associated with survival among CRC patients following a U-shape pattern; obesity was associated with high mortality after CRC diagnosis. These findings provide support for maintaining healthy weight to improve the survival of CRC patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We\\xa0evaluated suggested metastasis-related microRNAs (miRNAs) for their associations with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In a cohort of 456 TNBC cases, we systematically evaluated 57 previously reported metastasis-related miRNAs in tumor tissue using the NanoString nCounter assay. Cox regression was applied to evaluate miRNA expression in association with DFS and OS. In vitro assays using the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 were also conducted to validate epidemiological study findings. During a median follow-up of 5.3\\xa0years, 112 deaths and 97 recurrences were documented. High levels of miR-374b-5p, miR-218-5p, or miR-126-3p, or low levels of miR-27b-3p were independently associated with a favorable TNBC outcome (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01 for all). A composite score based on the levels of these four miRNAs was associated with DFS, with hazard ratios (95\\xa0% confidence interval) of 0.70 (0.43–1.15), 0.51 (0.29–0.90), and 0.18 (0.09–0.37) for the second, third, and fourth compared to the lowest quartile. Incorporating the miRNA score with known TNBC outcome\\xa0predictors, i.e., age at diagnosis, tumor stage, and basal-like subtype, increased the C-index for predicting DFS from 0.68 to 0.74. Additionally, miR-126-3p was correlated with basal-like breast cancer, and miR-374b-5p modified the therapeutic effects of 5-Fluorouracil and Cyclophosphamide treatments in basal-like breast cancer patients. Restoring miR-126-3p, miR-218-5p, or miR-374b-5p, or inhibiting miR-27b-3p in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced cell proliferation. miR-374b-5p suppressed cell invasion and miR-218-5p inhibited colonization. This study provides strong evidence that the expression\\xa0levels of miR-374b-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-126-3p, and miR-218-5p in tumor tissues predict TNBC outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Although several studies have evaluated the relationship between adult height and mortality, their results have not been entirely consistent. Little is known about components of adult height in relation to mortality, particularly in developing countries.We examined the association of adult height and its components (leg and trunk length) with mortality using data from 74 869 Chinese women and 61,333 men in the Shanghai Women's (1996-2008) and Men's (2002-2008) Health Studies. Anthropometric measurements, including standing and sitting height and weight, were taken at baseline by trained interviewers according to a standard protocol. Deaths were ascertained by biennial home visits and linkage with the vital statistics registry. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations.Neither height nor its components were associated with all-cause mortality. Height and, less consistently, its components were positively associated with cancer mortality, but inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for cancer mortality per 1-SD increment in height, trunk and leg length were 1.06 (1.01-1.12), 1.07 (1.01-1.12) and 1.03 (0.98-1.08), respectively, in women, and 1.13 (1.05-1.22), 1.09 (1.00-1.19) and 1.10 (1.03-1.16), respectively, in men. The corresponding HRs for CVD mortality were 0.89 (0.84-0.95), 0.93 (0.87-0.99) and 0.91 (0.86-0.98) in women, and 0.93 (0.86-1.02), 0.89 (0.81-0.98) and 0.99 (0.92-1.06) in men.Our results suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in linking height and its components with cancer and CVD mortality.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To prospectively investigate accelerated aging and its association with total mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality/recurrence among breast cancer survivors. This study included 4218 female breast cancer patients enrolled into a population-based cohort study approximately 6-month post-diagnosis. Information on aging-related symptoms (i.e., self-rated overall health condition, energy level, depression, sleep difficulty, and quality) was collected at 18- and 36-month post-diagnosis surveys. Information on overall health, daily function impairments, survival status, and recurrence was collected at 10-year post-diagnosis survey. Record linkages with vital statistics were conducted to collect mortality information. Cox proportional hazards model was applied. Among 3041 10-year survivors with a mean age of 63.7\\u2009±\\u20099.7\\xa0years, respectively, 52.3%, 19.0%, and 27.6% reported poor health, limitation in daily activity, and climbing floors. Age-specific prevalence revealed that breast cancer survivors reached similar prevalence of the functional limitations 5–10\\xa0years earlier than cancer-free women. At the 18-month post-diagnosis survey, respectively, 47.0%, 72.5%, and 25.1% of survivors reported unsatisfied overall health condition, reduced energy level, and depression symptoms. After a median follow-up of 10.9\\xa0years, low self-rated overall health, low energy level, and depression were significantly associated with increased total mortality, with hazard ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of 3.14 (2.43, 4.06), 1.49 (1.20, 1.84), and 1.59 (1.21, 2.09), respectively. Low self-rated health was associated with breast cancer-specific mortality/recurrence (HR\\u2009\\u20091.85, 95% CI 1.30, 2.65). No significant association was found for sleep difficulty and quality. Aging-related physical changes/symptoms are commonly presented at 18 months after breast cancer diagnosis and are associated with worse prognosis.

       "  'abstract': \"Objective To determine whether various levels of blood pressure (BP), particularly normal and high normal BP or prehypertension, predict cardiovascular mortality among urban Chinese women. Methods We evaluated the impact of all measures of BP on total mortality and stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD)-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study, the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Included in this analysis were 68438 women aged 40-70 years at baseline for whom BP was assessed. Results During an average of 5 years of follow-up, we identified 1574 deaths from all causes, 247 from stroke and 91 from CHD. Hypertension and higher levels of individual BP parameters including systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure were positively associated with all-cause, stroke, and CHD mortality (P-trend<0.05 for all except for DBP and CHD mortality). Prehypertension [adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj)=1.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-2.78], particularly high normal BP (HRadj=2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.12), was associated with an increased risk of mortality from stroke. Hypertension accounted for 9.3% of mortality from all causes, 25.5% of mortality from stroke, and 21.7% mortality from CHD. High normal BP accounted for 10.8% of mortality from stroke. Isolated systolic BP also predicted stroke and mortality from CHID. Conclusion Hypertension is a significant contributor to mortality, particularly stroke and CHID mortality, among women in Shanghai. High normal BP is associated with high stroke mortality. J Hypertens 27:468-475 (C) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.\",\n",

Patients were followed through December 2002. Information on ginseng use before cancer diagnosis was collected at baseline recruitment and was linked to survival. Survivors' ginseng use after cancer diagnosis was obtained at the follow-up survey and was correlated to QOL at the same time. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were applied to evaluate the association of ginseng use with overall and disease-free survival. The relation of ginseng use and QOL was evaluated by using multiple linear regression models. Approximately 27% of study participants were regular ginseng users before cancer diagnosis. Compared with patients who never used ginseng, regular users had a significantly reduced risk of death; adjusted hazard ratios associated with ginseng use were 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.52, 0.98) for total mortality and 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 0.93) for disease-specific mortality/recurrence. Ginseng use after cancer diagnosis, particularly current use, was positively associated with QOL scores, with the strongest effect in the psychological and social well-being domains. Additionally, QOL improved as cumulative ginseng use increased.\",\n",

Ever-use of any contraceptive method was not associated with overall cancer risk [adjusted hazard ratio (HR(adj)) = 1.02, 95% CI, 0.92-1.12]. Use of any contraceptive method was associated with increased risk of rectal cancer (HR(adj) = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.08-2.62) and reduced risk of thyroid cancer (HR(adj) = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.38-1.04). Risk of gallbladder cancer increased with ever use of OC (HR(adj) = 2.38, 95% CI, 1.26-4.49). IUD use was associated with a possible reduced risk of thyroid cancer (HR(adj) = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.38-1.07). Longer duration of IUD use decreased risk for breast, thyroid and lung cancers. Ever having a TS was associated with increased uterine body cancer (HR(adj) = 2.50, 95% CI, 1.47-4.25) and decreased risk of stomach cancer (HR(adj) = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.39-0.91). We did not find any contraceptive method to be related to the risk of ovarian cancer but the analyses were based on few events. Although chance findings are a likely explanation for some of the associations found in our study, these findings suggest that various contraceptive methods or reproductive patterns may play a role in the etiology of cancer.',\n",

Using the prospective cohort Shanghai Women's Health Study (1997-2008) including 718 Chinese breast cancer cases, the authors evaluated baseline dietary intake of these factors and breast cancer risk and whether the associations varied by menopausal status and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. They estimated associations using hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals from Cox proportional hazards regression models and stratified analyses by menopausal status and ER/PR status. Lowest quantile of intake was used as the comparison group. For postmenopausal women, dietary intakes of methionine and B vitamins were not associated with breast cancer risk. For premenopausal women, higher intake of folate was associated with decreased breast cancer risk (hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.34, 0.99 for the highest vs. lowest quintile of intake). Only niacin intake was associated with ER+/PR+ breast cancer risk (hazard ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.46; P for trend = 0.04 for the highest vs. lowest quartile of intake).

       "  'abstract': \"Quality of life (QOL) has become an integral part of the modern assessment of cancer treatment in Western society. However, little is known about the QOL of Chinese breast cancer survivors. To evaluate the long-term impact of medical and socio-demographic factors on survivors' QOL, we conducted a population-based study of 1065 breast cancer survivors in Shanghai, China. The mean age at diagnosis was 48.1 years and the median survival time was 4.3 years for the study participants. The Generic Quality of Life Inventory was used to assess survivors' QOL. Multiple linear regression models were employed to analyze the associations of QOL outcomes with socio-demographic and medical factors. The results revealed that recurrence status, time since diagnosis, marital status, income and education all had an independent, significant association with overall QOL and differential domains of QOL. Age at diagnosis exhibited a dual effect on QOL, positively associated with material well-being and negatively associated with physical well-being. Stage of disease was only associated with social well-being, while the type of surgery was related to material well-being alone. No associations between QOL and chemotherapy or radiotherapy were found. Further, analyses by survival intervals suggested a domain-specific order of recovery of QOL after cancer treatment. These results fill gaps in the limited literature, and provide valuable information for physicians to target the specific needs of Chinese women with breast cancer, choose appropriate interventions at the optimal time, and develop strategies accordingly in terms of improvement of patient's QOL.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Limited data are available on the prevalence of MetS and its association with exercise among breast cancer survivors. The present study included 1,696 breast cancer survivors from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a population-based prospective cohort study conducted between April 2002 and October 2011 in Shanghai, China. All women had a physical examination taken at study clinic approximately 60 months post-diagnosis. Exercise was assessed at approximately 6, 18, 36, and 60 months post-diagnosis. Information on medical history, tumor characteristics, cancer treatment, anthropometrics, and lifestyle was collected at study enrollment. Associations between exercise and MetS at 60 months post-diagnosis were evaluated with multivariable logistic regression models. The mean age of the study population was 56.68 at 60-month survey, and the mean follow-up since cancer diagnosis was 63.66 months. The prevalence of MetS using National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria at approximately 60 months after diagnosis was 33.14%. Among overweight and obesity breast cancer survivors (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m(2) at baseline), the prevalence was 55.18%. The most common type of exercise in this population was walking (45.40%) at baseline. Exercise participation between 6 and 60 months post-diagnosis was inversely associated with the prevalence of MetS with the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for exercise participation of ≥ 3.5 h/week (30 min/day) being 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.98). In addition consistent exercise participation reduced the prevalence of MetS (adjusted OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.50-1.00). Associations of exercise with MetS were not modified by baseline waist circumference, BMI, comorbidity, baseline menopausal status, TNM stage, cancer treatment, or ER/PR status (p interactions > 0.05). Regular and persistent exercise after cancer diagnosis, even at low-to-moderate intensity level, decreases the prevalence of MetS among long-term breast cancer survivors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '-160C-->A and -347G-->GA polymorphisms in the promoter region decrease E-cadherin gene transcription. Decreased E-cadherin expression predicts poor outcome among patients with cancer. We sought to investigate whether -160C-->A and/or -347G-->GA polymorphisms were associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to detect -160C-->A and -347G-->GA polymorphisms in deoxyribonucleic acid from the paraffin-embedded prostate tissues of 98 Caucasian patients.The genotype frequencies were -160C/C: 48% (47 of 98); -160C/A: 44% (43 of 98); -160A/A: 8% (8 of 98); -347G/G: 68% (67 of 98); -347G/GA: 28% (27 of 98); and -347GA/GA: 4% (4 of 98). Using the chi-square test, we found that the polymorphisms -160C-->A and -347G-->GA were not related to other clinical and pathologic parameters (i.e., age, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason grade, and clinical stage) (P > 0.05). In combination analysis, there was no significant relationship between patients with both -160C/C and -347G/G, and these same parameters (P > 0.05). Using the log-rank test, we found no significant difference in relapse-free survival and overall survival between patients with -160C/C and those with -160A/C or -160A/A (P = 0.0764 and 0.2746, respectively), and also no significant difference between patients with -347G/G and those with -347GA/G or -347GA/GA (P = 0.9416 and 0.7367, respectively). There was also no significant difference in relapse-free survival and overall survival between patients with homozygosities of -160C/-347G and patients with other genotypes (P = 0.1418 and 0.2434, respectively).We conclude that E-cadherin -160C-->A and/or -347G-->GA polymorphisms are not associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer in Caucasian patients.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Genetic polymorphisms in obesity-related genes and endometrial cancer risk.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin and endometrial cancer risk. Little is known about whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes that encode adiponectin (ADIPOQ), leptin (LEP), adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1), adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2), and leptin receptor (LEPR) are associated with endometrial cancer. METHODS: The authors selected 87 tagging SNPs to capture common genetic variants in these 5 genes. These SNPs were evaluated in 1028 endometrial cancer cases and 1932 community controls recruited from Chinese women. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Three of the 10 SNPs evaluated in the ADIPOQ gene were significantly associated with reduced cancer risk. The OR for women homozygous for the minor allele (A/A) for rs3774262 was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48-0.97) compared with women homozygous for the major allele (G/G). Similar results were found for SNPs rs1063539 and rs12629945 in ADIPOQ, which were in linkage disequilibrium with rs3774262. These associations became nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction was applied. Controls with the minor allele A at rs3774262 had lower weight, smaller waist and hip circumferences, and lower body mass index than controls with the major allele G (all P < .05). Women homozygous for the minor allele (T/T) of rs2071045 in the LEP gene also had significantly lower risk (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90) than women homozygous for the major allele (C/C). No other SNPs in the LEP, ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2, or LEPR genes were found to be associated with cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Although a chance finding cannot be ruled out, the consistency of findings for gene-endometrial cancer risk and gene-obesity measurements suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene may play a role in endometrial cancer development.

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Many foods and nutrients have been suggested to influence life expectancy. However, previous studies have not examined the relationship between dietary patterns and cause-specific mortality. Our study prospectively examines the relationship of dietary patterns with total mortality and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study of Chinese women. Methods: The Shanghai Women's Health Study is a population-based cohort study of 74,942 women age 40 to 70 years at the time of recruitment (September 1996 to May 2000). Detailed dietary information was collected using a validated, quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The cohort has been followed using a combination of in-person interviews and record linkage with various registries. Dietary patterns, derived from principal component analysis, were examined for their relation to total mortality and cause-specific mortality using Cox regression models. Results: After an average of 5.7 years of follow-up (423,717 person-years of observation), there were 1565 deaths. We derived 3 major dietary patterns (vegetable-rich, fruit-rich, and meat-rich). The adjusted hazard ratios for the fruit-rich diet were 0.94 (95% CI = 0.89-0.98) for all causes of death and 0.89 (0.81-0.99), 0.79 (0.69-0.91), and 0.51 (0.39-0.65) for death caused by cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes, respectively. The meat-rich diet was associated with increased risk of diabetes (HR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.98-1.42) and a slightly elevated risk of total mortality. Conclusion: In general, a fruit-rich diet was related to lower mortality, whereas a meat-rich diet appeared to increase the probability of death.\",\n",

Few epidemiologic investigations have evaluated the potential health effects of these foods in Asian populations. Objective: We aimed to examine the associations of cruciferous vegetables, noncruciferous vegetables, total vegetables, and total fruit intake with risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Design: The analysis included 134,796 Chinese adults who participated in 2 population-based, prospective cohort studies: the Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Shanghai Men's Health Study. Dietary intakes were assessed at baseline through in-person interviews by using validated food-frequency questionnaires. Deaths were ascertained by biennial home visits and linkage with vital statistics registries. Results: We identified 3442 deaths among women during a mean follow-up of 10.2 y and 1951 deaths among men during a mean follow-up of 4.6 y. Overall, fruit and vegetable intake was inversely associated with risk of total mortality in both women and men, and a dose-response pattern was particularly evident for cruciferous vegetable intake. The pooled multivariate hazard ratios (95% CIs) for total mortality across increasing quintiles of intake were 1 (reference), 0.91 (0.84, 0.98), 0.88 (0.77, 1.00), 0.85 (0.76, 0.96), and 0.78 (0.71, 0.85) for cruciferous vegetables (P < 0.0001 for trend) and 0.88 (0.79, 0.97), 0.88 (0.79, 0.98), 0.76 (0.62, 0.92), and 0.84 (0.69, 1.00) for total vegetables (P = 0.03 for trend). The inverse associations were primarily related to cardiovascular disease mortality but not to cancer mortality. Conclusion: Our findings support recommendations to increase consumption of vegetables, particularly cruciferous vegetables, and fruit to promote cardiovascular health and overall longevity.

Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether plasma concentrations of antioxidants, urinary excretion rates of polyphenols, and antioxidants in food and dietary supplements are attributable to both urinary F-2-IsoP and 15-F-2t-IsoP-M concentrations. Design: Dietary intake information and blood and urine samples were obtained from 845 healthy middle-aged and elderly female participants of the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Urinary isoprostanes (F-2-IsoPs and 15-F-2t-IsoP-M) were measured and adjusted for creatinine concentrations. Results: Urinary 15-F-2t-IsoP-M and F-2-IsoP concentrations were lower in subjects who used a multivitamin. Lower F-2-IsoP concentrations were observed in ginseng users, whereas lower concentrations of 15-F-2t-IsoP-M were shown in subjects who used a vitamin E supplement. Plasma concentrations of several antioxidants (ie, beta-carotenes, both trans and cis beta-carotenes, lycopene other than trans, 5-cis and 7-cis isomers, cis anhydrolutein, and cis beta-cryptoxanthin) were inversely associated with 15-F-2t-IsoP-M but not with F-2-IsoPs, whereas beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols were positively associated with 15-F-2t-IsoP-M but not with F-2-IsoPs. Urinary polyphenol quercetin was positively associated with both F-2-IsoPs and 15-F-2t-IsoP-M. Conclusion: The results suggest that the F-2-IsoP major metabolite 15-F-2t-IsoP-M may be a more sensitive marker of endogenous oxidative stress status than are F-2-IsoPs in the assessment of effects of antioxidants on age-related diseases.

       "  'abstract': 'Quasi-two-dimensional gallium chalcogenide heterostructures are created by transferring exfoliated few-layer GaSe onto bulk GaTe sheets. Luminescence spectroscopy measurements reveal that the light emission from underlying GaTe layers drastically increases on heterojunction regions where GaSe layers make contact with the GaTe. Density functional theory (DFT) and band offset calculations show that conduction band minimum (CBM) (valance band maximum (VBM)) values of GaSe are higher (lower) in energy compared to GaTe, forming type-I band alignment at the interface. Consequently, GaSe layers provide photo-excited electrons and holes to GaTe sheets through relatively large built-in potential at the interface, increasing overall exciton population and light emission from GaTe. Observed results are not specific to the GaSe/GaTe system but observed on GaS/GaSe heterolayers with type-I band alignment. Observed experimental findings and theoretical studies provide unique insights into interface effects across dissimilar gallium chalcogenides and offer new ways to boost optical performance by simple epitaxial coating.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Layered semiconductor gallium telluride (GaTe) undergoes a rapid structural transition to a degraded phase in ambient conditions, limiting its utility in devices such as optical switches. In this work, we demonstrate that the degradation process in GaTe flakes can be slowed down dramatically via encapsulation with graphene. Through examining Raman signatures of degradation, we show that the choice of substrate significantly impacts the degradation rate and that the process is accelerated by the transfer of GaTe to hydrophilic substrates such as SiO/Si. We find that double encapsulation with both top and bottom graphene layers can extend the lifetime of the material for several weeks. The photoresponse of flakes encapsulated in this way is only reduced by 17.6 ± 0.4% after 2 weeks, whereas unencapsulated flakes display no response after this time. Our results demonstrate the potential for alternative, van der Waals material-based passivation strategies in unstable layered materials and highlight the need for careful selection of substrates for 2D electronic devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Aim To investigate the influence of total flavonoids of epimedium on adiponectin receptors expression in hyperlipidemia rats and the mechanism of protection in hyperlipidemia rats. Methods 35 male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups: high cholesterol diet group(n=26) and control group(n=9).Rats of high-fat diet group were fed with high-fat diet for 12 weeks,then 26 SD male rats were randomly divided into three groups: model group,high hyperlipidemia group with low dose total flavonoids of epimedium(100 mg/kg) group,hyperlipidemia group with high dose total flavonoids of epimedium(200 mg/kg) group.Serum lipid levels of all rats were measured and the aorta was taken for pathologic analysis.Serum adiponectin was detected by ELISA.The expression of both adiponectin receptor 1(AdipoR1) and adiponectin receptor 2(AdipoR2) on the aorta were analyzed by realtime PCR and Western boltting. Results After 12 weeks of feeding,as compared with full diet group,the levels of triglyceride(TG),total cholesterol(TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDLC) in high cholesterol diet groups were significantly increased(P<0.01),which indicated that the hyperlipidemia model was estimated.After 4 weeks' treatment,as compared with high hyperlipidemia model group,the levels of TC,TG in total flavonoids of epimedium groups were obviously lower(P<0.05 or 0.01).Aortic intimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cells proliferation in rats fed with high cholesterol diet were decreased in high hyperlipidemia with total flavonoids of epimedium groups.As compared with high hyperlipidemia model group,the serum levels of adiponectin with total flavonoids of epimedium were increased(P<0.05),moreover,these changes were more significant in high dose treated group(P<0.05),and the expression of both AdipoR1 mRNA and AdipoR2 mRNA were significantly increased(P<0.05 or 0.01),moreover,the expression of AdipoR1 mRNA were significant in high dose treated group.The expression levels of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 protein in total flavonoids of epimedium group were significantly higher than that of hyperlipidemia model group. Conclusion Total flavonoids of epimedium can reduce the levels of serum lipids,but increase the levels of serum adiponectin and the mRNA and protein expression of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 on the aorta in hyperlipidemia rats.\",\n",

We investigated associations of fish intake, assessed through a validated food frequency questionnaire, with risks of total and cause-specific mortality in 2 prospective cohort studies of 134,296 Chinese men and women (1997-2009). Vital status and date and cause of death were ascertained through annual linkage to the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry database and biennial home visits. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. After excluding the first year of observation, the analysis included 3,666 deaths among women and 2,170 deaths among men. Fish intake was inversely associated with risks of total, ischemic stroke, and diabetes mortality; the corresponding hazard ratios for the highest quintiles of intake compared with the lowest were 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76, 0.92), 0.63 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.94), and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.95), respectively. No associations with cancer or ischemic heart disease mortality were observed. Further analyses suggested that the inverse associations with total, ischemic stroke, and diabetes mortality were primarily related to consumption of saltwater fish and intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids. Overall, our findings support the postulated health benefits of fish consumption.',\n",

Method: 60 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (sham group,n=8) and surgical group (n=52). The rats of surgical group induced by the abdominal aorta constriction preparation. 32 rats of surgical group survived and were randomly divided into four groups (n=8):model group, TanⅡA low dose group (L-TanⅡA group), TanⅡA high dose group (H-TanⅡA group) and positive captopril group (captopril group). After 4 weeks, heart mass indexes were estimated, in concurrent evaluation of myocardial histology, as well as myocardial hydroxyproline content by ELISA, and immunohistochemistry staining for myocardial ROCK1, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) protein content. Results: Compared with those in sham group, heart mass indexes, myocardial hydroxyproline content and myocardial ROCK1, TGF-β1 and NF-κB p65 content were increased in the model group (P<0.01); Compared with those in model group, heart mass indexes, myocardial hydroxyproline content and myocardial ROCK1, TGF-β1 and NF-κB p65 content were decreased in the L-TanⅡA group (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while these indexes were decreased significantly in the H-Tan Ⅱ A group (P<0.01). Conclusion: TanⅡA can improve myocardial fibrosis in rats with pressure overload and this effect may be related to inhibition of ROCK1 expression, downregulation of TGF-β1 and NF-κB p65 expression.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize the current advance in the candidate gene polymorphisms of osteoporosis.DATA SOURCES: An online search of Medline database was undertaken by using theof\"osteoporosis, candidate gene, polymorphism, vitamin D receptor gene, estrogen receptor gene, insulin-like growth factor gene, IL-6 gene, transforming growth factor beta gene, calcitonin receptor gene, COLIA gene\"to identify the articles about osteoporosis published in English from January 1998 to May 2004.STUDY SELECTION: The articles about the relationship between osteoporosis and candidate gene polymorphisms were selected after first trial. Some articles obviously lacking of randomized controlled trial were eliminated. The rest full texts were obtained, excluding reviews.DATA EXTRACTION: Totally 197 accorded articles were collected, and 27 related ones were selected according to the new views about the relationship between candidate genes and osteoporosis. Of the 170 excluded ones, 105 were non-randomized or repetitive studies, and the other 65 were reviews.DATA SYNTHESIS: The data of the selected articles were concluded. The studies of the relationship between candidate genes and osteoporosis in etiology and pathogenesis were summarized and evaluated. Many candidate genes participate in regulating primary osteoporosis. It is unknown which are the major genes to result in osteoporosis. However, it is certain that genes play important roles in etiology, which contribute to bone mineral density and peak bone mass, etc. CONCLUSION: Many candidate genes polymorphisms, such as vitamin D receptor gene, estrogen receptor gene, insulin-like growth factor gene etc., are relevant to bone mineral density, peak bone mass, bone stiffness index, the rate to fracture and so on. It was showed that gene polymorphisms play a crucial role in osteoporosis.',\n",

In-person interviews, using a validated food-frequency questionnaire, were conducted to collect data on dietary habits. Follow-up consisted of in-person surveys and record linkage. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for potential confounders to compare liver cancer risk among participants with high vs low vitamin intake. All statistical tests were two-sided.After excluding the first 2 years of follow-up, 267 participants (including 118 women and 149 men) developed liver cancer during an average of 10.9 (Shanghai Women's Health Study) or 5.5 (Shanghai Men's Health Study) years of follow-up. Dietary vitamin E intake was inversely associated with liver cancer risk (P(trend) = .01), as was vitamin E supplement use (hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval = 0.30 to 0.90). This association was consistent among participants with and without self-reported liver disease or a family history of liver cancer. Vitamin C and multivitamin use was associated with increased risk among participants with self-reported liver disease or family history of liver cancer, whereas intake of vitamin C and other vitamins from dietary sources was unrelated to liver cancer risk.Vitamin E intake, either from diet or supplements, may reduce the risk of liver cancer.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of curcumin on the osteoclastogenic potential of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. PBMCs from patients with RA (n=12) and healthy controls (n=10) were cultured to assess osteoclastogenic potential. The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts differentiated from PBMCs isolated from patients with RA was significantly increased compared with that of the healthy controls. In addition, the osteoclast number in patients with RA was correlated with the clinical indicators, Sharp score (r=0.810; P=0.001) and lumbar T-score (r=-0.685; P=0.014). Furthermore, the resorption area was increased in the RA group compared with the healthy controls. The mRNA and protein expression levels in PBMC-derived osteoclasts treated with curcumin were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Curcumin inhibited the osteoclastogenic potential of PBMCs, potentially by suppressing activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and inhibiting receptor activator of nuclear factor B (RANK), c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) expression. The results of the present study demonstrated that curcumin may inhibit the osteoclastogenic potential of PBMCs from patients with RA through the suppression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/RANK/c-Fos/NFATc1 signaling pathways, and that curcumin may be a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of bone deterioration in inflammatory diseases such as RA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"We recently reported an inverse association between soy food intake and lung cancer risk among nonsmoking women. The effect size for aggressive lung cancers was larger than that observed for other types of lung cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that soy consumption may favorably affect the overall survival of patients with lung cancer.This analysis included 444 women with incident lung cancer identified from the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Prediagnosis soy food intake was assessed at enrollment and reassessed 2 years later. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between soy food intake and overall survival.Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during follow-up. Initial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factors. Larger effect sizes for the association were found after additional adjustment for tumor stage and treatment in analyses including 301 patients with data available on these clinical factors. Compared with the median intake of soy food, fully adjusted hazard ratios for total mortality associated with the 10th, 30th, 70th, and 90th percentiles of intake were 1.81 (95% CI, 1.26 to 2.59), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.42), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16), respectively. Similar inverse associations were observed for dietary isoflavone intake.This study suggests, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that, among women with lung cancer, prediagnosis intake of soy food is associated with better overall survival.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The strong light-matter interaction and the valley selective optical selection rules make monolayer (ML) MoS2 an exciting 2D material for fundamental physics and optoelectronics applications. But, so far, optical transition linewidths even at low temperature are typically as large as a few tens of meV and contain homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions. This prevented in-depth studies, in contrast to the better-characterized ML materials MoSe2 and WSe2. In this work, we show that encapsulation of ML MoS2 in hexagonal boron nitride can efficiently suppress the inhomogeneous contribution to the exciton linewidth, as we measure in photoluminescence and reflectivity a FWHM down to 2 meV at T = 4 K. Narrow optical transition linewidths are also observed in encapsulated WS2, WSe2, and MoSe2 MLs. This indicates that surface protection and substrate flatness are key ingredients for obtaining stable, high-quality samples. Among the new possibilities offered by the well-defined optical transitions, we measure the homogeneous broadening induced by the interaction with phonons in temperature-dependent experiments. We uncover new information on spin and valley physics and present the rotation of valley coherence in applied magnetic fields perpendicular to the ML.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) project in Nanjing western power system (NWPS) has been put into operation since December 2015. As the first project based on modular multi-level converter (MMC) technology in the world, it represents the highest level in the field of flexible alternative current transmission system (FACTS). Therefore, the real operation conditions of this project are important for the research and extended utilization of UPFC. In this paper, necessity and feasibility for the application of UPFC in NWPS is firstly introduced. Then, preset system-level control strategy of UPFC is discussed. Afterwards, based on load characteristics of NWPS in 2016, real system control strategy of UPFC and its balance for power flow from north and south-transferred channels is deeply analyzed. The analysis shows that the application of UPFC can effectively solve the problems of power flow misdistribution, insufficient power supply capacity and huge investment for construction of new transmission channels in NWPS. This project plays an exemplary role to promote FACTS technology for power grids with high city urbanization levels to improve power supply capability.',\n",

These rats were divided into 4 groups randomly: sham group, model group, fasudil high-dose group (FH, 30mgKgd) and fasudil low-dose group (FL, 10mgKgd). At 8 weeks after surgery, the left ventricleweight index (LVWI) were calculated, and the content of cardiac hydroxyproline (HYP) was measured using alkaline hydrolysis. Myocardial histopathology and interstitial fibrosis were detected with HE and Masson staining. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Results: Comparing with sham group, the LVWI and HYP content were significantly elevated in model group (P<0.01). Much more collagen deposited in myocardial interstitium. Rho kinase activity was significantly elevated, associated with increased TGF-β1 and CTGF(P<0.01). Comparing with the model group, fasudil reduced the LVWI and HYP content, and reduced interstitial collagen deposition. Rho kinase activity was significantly decreased associated with much lower expression of TGF-β1 and CTGF (P<0.05). Conclusion: Rho kinase plays an important role in abdominal aortic constriction induced myocardial fibrosis. Decreased TGF-β1 and CTGF partly contribute to the protective effect of fasudil on heart against pressure-overload.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cruciferous vegetables are a major source of glucosinolate-derived bioactive compounds such as isothiocyanates, which have been shown in animal and in vitro studies to inhibit cancer growth and progression. Few studies have investigated cruciferous vegetable intake after diagnosis and breast cancer outcomes. Using data from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project, which includes prospective data from U. S. and Chinese breast cancer survivors, we evaluated the association of cruciferous vegetables with breast cancer outcomes. Analyses included 11,390 women diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast cancer (1990-2006) from four cohorts. Cruciferous vegetable intake (g/day) was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (mean of 22 months postdiagnosis). Study heterogeneity was evaluated by the Q statistic; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using delayed-entry Cox regression models stratified by study. After a median follow-up of 9.0 years, 1,725 deaths and 1,421 recurrences were documented. In pooled analyses using study-specific quartiles, cruciferous vegetable intake was not associated with breast cancer outcomes, adjusting for known clinical prognostic factors and selected lifestyle factors. HRs (95% CIs) by increasing quartiles (reference = lowest quartile) were 1.08 (0.93-1.25), 1.01 (0.87-1.18), and 1.10 (0.95-1.28) for recurrence (P-trend = 0.34) and 1.01 (0.88-1.15), 0.97 (0.84-1.11), and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for total mortality (P-trend = 0.84). No associations were observed for subgroups defined by estrogen receptor status, stage, or tamoxifen therapy. Cruciferous vegetable intake at approximately two years after diagnosis was not associated with recurrence or mortality. Our results do not support an association between postdiagnosis cruciferous vegetable intake and breast cancer outcomes. (C) 2013 AACR.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has varied markedly between different studies because of the lack of internationally agreed-upon criteria to define the condition. We estimated the prevalence and lifestyle risk factors of metabolic syndrome according to three definitions of metabolic syndrome in urban Chinese men participating in the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 3988 middle-aged, urban Chinese men 40-74 years of age who were free of type 2 diabetes at baseline provided fasting blood samples, anthropometric measurements, and information on lifestyle factors and disease history. Results: The three definitions of metabolic syndrome used in this report are from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the U.S. Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), and a modified version of the ATP III criteria for Asian populations (ATP III-modified criteria). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 18.63%,18.36%, and 29.34% according to IDF, ATP 111, and ATP III-modified criteria, respectively. Agreement between the IDF and ATP III criteria was moderate (kappa = 0.43), whereas agreement between ATP III-modified and the IDF and ATP III criteria was good (kappa = 0.71 and 0.70, respectively). Physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, whereas drinking more than three drinks per day was associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, regardless of the criteria employed. The association between smoking and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this population failed to reach significance. Conclusions: Results from this representative sample of middle-aged, urban Chinese men show that metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in this population. Our data support the hypothesis that physical activity decreases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and that high alcohol consumption increases risk.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Purpose: High animal protein intake is a risk factor for nephrolithiasis. Whether plant based sources of protein are associated with kidney stone risk is not well studied. We examined the association of animal and plant protein intake with the risk of incident kidney stones in Shanghai, China. Materials and Methods: Dietary intakes were obtained from a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Self-reported stone events were ascertained at baseline and at followup visits. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations of protein intake with the incident stone risk. Results: During 319,211 and 696,950 person-years of followup 1,451 men and 1,202 women, respectively, reported incident stones. The average +/- SD intake of animal and plant protein standardized to 2,000 kcal was 31.3 +/- 13.7 and 48.4 +/- 7.2 gm per day in women, and 30.8 +/- 13.3 and 51.3 +/- 7.6 gm per day, respectively, in men. On multivariable analysis participants in the highest quintiles of animal and nondairy animal protein intake showed an increased risk of incident stones compared to those in the lowest quintiles (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.32, p=0.03 vs HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.30, p=0.04). Compared to the lowest quintile the highest intake quintiles of the animal-to-plant protein ratios and the nondairy animal-to-plant protein ratios were positively associated with stone risk (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.33, p=0.02 and HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36, p=0.005, respectively). No association was observed with plant protein intake (p(trend)=0.14). Conclusions: In this population with a relatively low animal protein intake and a high plant protein intake, a greater animal protein intake was associated with a kidney stone risk. Increasing the proportion of plant protein relative to animal protein appeared protective against the risk.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nine previously reported associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and breast cancer outcomes from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study (Stage 1) were further evaluated in relation to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) among 5,192 additional breast cancer patients (Stage 2).Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by proportional hazards regression in models adjusted for age, disease stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and treatment regimens.Two SNPs had generally consistent results and significant associations with OS in combined analyses. Compared to women with MMP7 rs11225297 AA genotypes, OS was moderately better for women with AT genotypes (HR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-1.0) and much better for women with TT genotypes (HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8). Compared to women with MMP8 rs11225395 CC genotypes, OS was slightly better for women with CT genotypes (HR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7-1.1) and moderately better for women with TT genotypes (HR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). Joint analysis showed significant dose-response relationships with increasing numbers of rare alleles for both OS (p < 0.001) and DFS (p = 0.001).A functional variant in MMP8 and a SNP in high linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant in MMP7 were significantly associated with breast cancer survival in a large two-stage survival study among Chinese women. This supports the hypothesis that SNPs in matrix metalloproteinase genes may influence breast cancer prognosis; additional research on these and other SNPs in genes important in metastasis, angiogenesis, and the regulation of the tumor microenvironment is warranted.',\n",

Genetic variation in the PPARD gene might affect physical endurance and has been associated with obesity. We investigated the independent and modifying effect of variants in the PPARD gene with exercise participation and body mass index (BMI) on type 2 diabetes (T2D), using data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of middle-aged women living in Shanghai, China, with 1019 T2D cases and 1709 controls. The genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform. Imputation was used to determine missing genotypes. Participation in exercise was assessed by a questionnaire. Anthropometric variables were measured by trained interviewers. The association between polymorphisms and T2D was assessed by logistic regression analyses. The combined effects of polymorphisms in the PPARD gene with exercise participation and BMI on T2D risk was assessed by conducting stratified analysis with exercise participation and BMI categories. No significant associations between PPARD and T2D were found in either genotyped or imputed SNPs and no effect modification between exercise participation and PPARD genetic variation was found, suggesting that PPARD is not a risk factor for T2D in this population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that transplantation of controlled release glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells (BMSCs) can effectively promote the motor function recovery of rhesus monkeys with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: To validate whether GDNF+BMSCs transplantation exhibits better protective effects on spinal cord tissue of rhesus monkeys with spinal cord injury than BMSCs transplantation. METHODS: Rhesus monkey models of acute severe spinal cord injury were divided into three groups and received GDNF+BMSCs transplantation (GDNF+BMSCs group) or BMSCs transplantation (BMSCs group) or PBS administration (control group). Spinal cord tissue was embedded with paraffin and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Myelosyringosis was estimated by image analysis system. RESULTS: In the control group, spinal cord structure was greatly destructed, and myelosyringosis occupied larger area. In the BMSCs group, spinal cord structure was well preserved, and small cavities, occasionally large cavities, were observed. In the GDNF+BMSCs group, spinal cord structure was best preserved and only small cavities were observed. There was significant difference in spinal cord structure destruction between groups (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that compared with simple BMSCs transplantation, transplantation of controlled released GDNF+BMSCs shows better protective effects on spinal tissue structure after spinal cord injury, which may be one of mechanisms by which myelosyringosis is reduced to a greater extent.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Polyphenols, the most abundant dietary antioxidants, also possess many other anticarcinogenic activities. Urinary metabolites of polyphenols could complement dietary assessment of the bioavailability of these nutrients. We conducted a study of 353 incident breast cancer cases and 701 individually matched controls nested within the Shanghai Women's Health Study cohort of women aged 40-70 years at baseline. Liquid chromatography photo-diode array electrospray mass spectrometry was used to measure tea polyphenols (epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and their metabolites) and flavonols (e.g., quercetin and kaempferol). Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between breast cancer risk and urinary excretion rates of polyphenols. Urinary excretion of tea polyphenols increased with increasing tea leaves consumed among controls, but not among breast cancer cases. Compared with cases, controls had higher levels of urinary total polyphenols and tea polyphenols, particularly epicatechin. In contrast, we did not find any dose-response relationship between urinary polyphenols and breast cancer risk. Urinary excretion of epicatechin was inversely associated with breast cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.59 (0.39-0.88) for the intermediate tertile]. In spline regression, we found an overall dose-response relationship between epicatechin level and risk of breast cancer, although it was not apparent in low and middle urinary excretion range. In conclusion, high epicatechin may be related to a reduced risk of breast cancer. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Obesity has been well studied in relation to breast cancer survival. However, the associations of post-diagnosis obesity and late outcomes (≥5 years after diagnosis) have been much less studied. A total of 4062 5-year disease-free patients were recruited from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a longitudinal study of patients diagnosed during 2002-2006. Cox proportional hazard model with restricted cubic spline were used to evaluate the potential non-linear associations of post-diagnosis body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with late all-cause mortality and late recurrence. While no significant association was observed for post-diagnosis BMI or WHR with late recurrence; a U-shaped association was observed for the two measures with late all-cause death. Women with BMI of 25.0\\u2009kg/m(2) or WHR of 0.83 were at the lowest risk of late all-cause mortality, whereas those with BMI beyond the range of 22.1-28.7\\u2009kg/m(2) or WHR beyond the range of 0.81-0.86 had a higher risk. ER, stage or menopausal status did not modify the effect of post-diagnosis BMI or WHR on the outcomes. In conclusion, post-diagnosis BMI and WHR, as indicators of overall and central obesity respectively, were associated with late all-cause mortality in U-shaped pattern among long-term breast cancer survivors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Adherence to dietary recommendations has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality in healthy populations. Little is known about the possible benefits of adherence to dietary recommendations among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Dietary information was collected using food frequency questionnaires at the 5-year postdiagnosis survey in 3,450 5-year breast cancer survivors from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study. Adherence scores to Chinese Food Pagoda (CHFP)-2007, CHFP-2016, modified Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) were created. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total mortality and breast cancer-specific events according to adherence scores. Results: Participants in the highest quartiles of CHFP-2007, CHFP-2016, and DASH had 25% to 34% lower risk of total mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.89 for CHFP-2007; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55-1.01 for CHFP-2016; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91 for DASH), and 36% to 40% lower risk of breast cancer-specific events (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.93 for CHFP2007; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99 for CHFP-2016; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90 for DASH) comparing with the lowest quartiles. Associations did not vary by known prognostic factors. HEI-2015 scores were not significantly associated with breast cancer outcomes. Conclusions: Higher adherence to CHFP and DASH dietary guidelines post-cancer diagnosis was associated with reduced risk of both overall death and breast cancer-specific recurrence or death among long-term breast cancer survivors. Impact: Our study highlights the importance of overall dietary quality among long-term breast cancer survivors.',\n",

The study included 195 randomly selected participants of the SMHS who completed one FFQ at baseline, twelve 24-hour dietary recalls (24-HDR) (once a month for twelve consecutive months) and a second FFQ at the end of the study. The FFQ accounted for 8878 % of the foods recorded in the 24-HDR surveys. The validity of the FFQ was evaluated by comparing nutrient and food group intake levels from the second FFQ and the multiple 24-HDR. Correlation coefficients ranged from 038 to 0.64 for macronutrients, 033 to 0.58 for micronutrients and 035 to 0.72 for food groups. Misclassification to opposite quartiles for nutrients and food groups was rare, ranging from 1.5 to 7.7%, while exact agreement rates were between 31.8 and 533 %. The reliability of the FFQ was assessed by comparing the intake levels from the two FFQ. Correlation coefficients were 0.39 to 0.53 for macronutrients, 0.38 to 0.52 for micronutrients and 0.39 to 0.64 for food groups. Exact agreement rates for quartile distribution were between 31.8 and 49.2 %, while misclassification to opposite quartiles was between 1.5 and 6.2 %. These data indicate that the SMHS FFQ can reasonably categorise usual intake of nutrients and food groups among men living in urban Shanghai.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Because the association between soy consumption and gastric cancer is inconsistent, we evaluated the putative preventive effect of soy food on gastric cancer risk in the Shanghai Women's and Men's Health Studies, comprising a total of 128,687 participants. Intake of nonfermented soy foods was estimated using 2 validated food-frequency questionnaires. HRs were calculated with 95% CIs for intake amounts of total nonfermented soy food intake, soy protein, and isoflavones as well as individual soy food groups using Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 493 distal gastric cancer cases were identified by 2010. Although all risk estimates for summary measures of soy food intake above the lowest quartile (quartile 1) were suggestive of a protective effect, no statistically significant associations with risk of distal gastric cancer were found. Among the separate soy food groups, significant reductions in risk of distal gastric cancer by increasing intake of tofu were found in men in quartile 2 (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.86), quartile 3 (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.88), and quartile 4 (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.99), resulting in a significant trend (P-trend = 0.02). Dry bean intake was also inversely associated with decreased risk of gastric cancer, but in postmenopausal women only [quartile 2 (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.96); quartile 3 (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.27); and quartile 4 (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.91)], resulting in a significant trend (P-trend = 0.03). Overall, our study found no statistically significant association between nonfermented soy food intake and distal gastric cancer risk, though the data supported the hypothesis that tofu may protect against distal gastric cancer in men and dry bean consumption may decrease the risk of gastric cancer in postmenopausal women. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The synthesis and comparative examination of 3-5, analogues of deglycobleomycin A(2) (2) which address the inferred importance of the L-histidine secondary amide directly, are detailed. The agent 3 lacks only the L-histidine beta-hydroxy group of deglycobleomycin A(2) and the corresponding agents 4 and 5 incorporate a tertiary N-methyl amide and simple ester in place of the L-histidine secondary amide. The DNA cleavage properties of 3 proved essentially indistinguishable from those of deglycobleomycin A(2) (2) confirming that the distinctions between bleomycin A(2) (1) and deglycobleomycin (2) are due to the removal of the disaccharide and not the introduction of the L-histidine free beta-hydroxy group. The agents 4 and 5 containing a tertiary N-methyl amide and ester in place of the L-histidine secondary amide were found to cleave duplex DNA but to do so in a nonsequence selective fashion with a substantially reduced efficiency and a diminished double to single strand cleavage ratio that are only slightly greater than that of free iron itself. These latter observations establish the functional requirement for the L-histidine secondary amide and are consistent with the proposals that the L-histidine deprotonated secondary amide is required for functional metal chelation and activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent chronic disease worldwide. The prevalence of T2DM is increasing rapidly in China. Understanding the contribution of modifiable lifestyle factors on T2DM risk is imperative to prevent the development of T2DM in China.We examined associations between lifestyle factors including physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption with incidence of T2DM among middle-aged and elderly men in urban Shanghai. Information on socio-demographics, lifestyle habits, dietary habits, and disease history was collected via in-person interviews. Anthropometric measurements were taken. A total of 51 464 Chinese men aged 40-74 years free of T2DM, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke at baseline were included in the current study. Incident T2DM was identified through follow-up surveys conducted every 2-3 years. Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between lifestyle risk factors and incidence of T2DM.We documented 1304 new cases of T2DM during 276 929 person-years of follow-up (average: 5.4 years). Physical activity was inversely associated with T2DM risk. Daily living, commuting, and total physical activity METs had inverse negative dose-response relationships with T2DM (P-trend = 0.0033, 0.0022, and <0.0001, respectively). Regular participation in exercise or sports reduced T2DM risk (HR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.76-0.98). Moderate alcohol intake (1-3 drinks/day) was inversely related to T2DM risk (HR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.67-0.94). Cigarette smoking, on the other hand, was associated with increased T2DM risk; HRs were 1.25 (95%CI: 1.00-1.56) for smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day and 1.28 (95%CI: 1.04-1.57) for smoking more than 40 pack-years.Physical activity and moderate alcohol intake are inversely associated with T2DM risk, whereas smoking was positively associated with T2DM risk among middle-age and elderly Chinese men. Preventive measures should be developed to focus on these modifiable lifestyle habits to reduce the upward trend of T2DM.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Little is known regarding the role of early-life exercise, a potentially modifiable factor, in long-term adult morbidity and mortality. We utilized the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) to investigate adolescent exercise in association with cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality among middle-aged and older women. Methods: The SWHS is a prospective cohort of 74,941 Chinese women ages 40 to 70 years recruited from 1996 to 2000. In-person interviews at enrollment assessed adolescent and adult exercise history, medical and reproductive history, and other lifestyle and socioeconomic (SES) factors. Mortality follow-up occurs via annual linkage to the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from Cox regression models. Results: Adjusting for birth year and other adolescent factors, adolescent exercise was associated with reduced risk of cancer, CVD, and total mortality [HRs (95% CI), 0.83 (0.72-0.95), 0.83 (0.70-0.98), and 0.78 (0.71-0.85), respectively for <= 1.33 hours (h)/week, and 0.83 (0.74-0.93), 0.62 (0.53-0.72), and 0.71 (0.66-0.77), respectively for > 1.33 h/week (reference = none)]. Results were attenuated after adjustment for adult SES and lifestyle factors. Participation in sports teams was inversely associated with cancer mortality [HR (95% CI), 0.86 (0.76-0.97)]. Joint adolescent and adult exercise was associated with reduced risk of all-cause, CVD, and cancermortality [HRs (95% CIs), 0.80 (0.72-0.89), 0.83 (0.691.00), and 0.87 (0.74-1.01), respectively], adjusting for adult/adolescent factors, and adolescence exercise only was inversely associated with cancer mortality [HR (95% CI), 0.84 (0.71-0.98)]. Conclusions: Adolescent exercise participation, independent of adult exercise, was associated with reduced risk of cancer, CVD, and all-cause mortality. Impact: Results support promotion of exercise in adolescence to reduce mortality in later life. (C) 2015 AACR.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The prevalence of hypertension has increased over the past decade in many developed and developing countries, including China. This increase may be associated with changes in lifestyle, including dietary patterns. We evaluated the association of dietary patterns with blood pressure (BP) by using data from a large, population-based cohort study of middle-aged and elderly Chinese men, the Shanghai Men's Health Study. The present cross-sectional analysis includes 39 252 men who reported no prior history of hypertension, diabetes, CHD, or stroke nor use of antihypertensive drugs at study enrolment. Three dietary patterns, 'vegetable', 'fruit and milk' and 'meat', were derived using factor analysis. The fruit and milk diet was inversely associated with both systolic and diastolic BP (P-trend < 0.001). The adjusted mean systolic BP was 2.9 mmHg lower (95% CI -3.4, -2.4), and diastolic BP was 1.7 mmHg lower (95% CI -2.0, -1.4) for men in the highest quintile of the 'fruit and milk' pattern compared with men in the lowest quintile. This inverse association was more evident among heavy drinkers; the highest quintile of the 'fruit and milk' pattern was associated with a 4.1 mmHg reduction in systolic BP v. a 2.0 mmHg reduction among non-drinkers (P-interaction = 0.003) compared to the lowest quintile. The corresponding reductions in diastolic BP were 2.0 v. 1.3 mmHg (P-interaction = 0.011). The 'fruit and milk' pattern was associated with a lower prevalence of both pre-hypertension and hypertension, and the associations appeared to be stronger among drinkers. Results of the present study suggest an important role for diet in the prevention of hypertension.\",\n",

Methods: Characteristics of and factors associated with t'ai chi practice among middle-aged and elder Chinese in Shanghai China were analyzed utilizing baseline data from the Shanghai Women's Health Study and Shanghai Men's Health Study. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify independent factors associated with the practice of t'ai chi among men and women. Results: T'ai chi is the most common form of regular exercise in Shanghai China among middle-aged and elderly persons (22%), including among women (28%) and men (15%). Other popular forms of exercise were walking (7%), dancing (4%), and jogging (3%). A majority of adults who practiced t'ai chi used it as their exclusive type of exercise (69%). Overall, t'ai chi practitioners as compared to nonpractitioners were more likely women, older, more educated, retired versus still working, and more likely to report chronic medical conditions including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular conditions. T'ai chi activity was associated with other health behaviors including nonsmoking, consuming ginseng, and participating in other forms of physical exercise. Conclusions: T'ai chi is the predominant form of exercise among middle-aged and elderly Chinese in urban China, particularly among those with older age and chronic medical diseases. Future research is needed to see whether t'ai chi has similar or different benefits than conventional forms of exercise such as walking and jogging.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objectives: To investigate the DNA sequence variations of Helicobacter pylori in the oral cavities and stomachs of children with chronic gastritis. Methods: Dental plaques and gargle on 235 patients were obtained before gastroscopy. Gastric H. pylori infection was diagnosed using rapid urease test or Giemsa staining. H. pylori 16S rDNA and CagA gene were analyzed using PCR methods. Thymine adenine cloning-based sequencing was performed in patients with CagA gene positive from oral cavities. The sequence alignments and V1 variable region were evaluated by comparison with the sequence of the standard H. pylori 26695 strain. Results: Totally, 46 out of the 235 patients were positive for gastric H. pylori infection. Of the 46 patients, 26 cases had amplified H. pylori 16S rDNA in both oral (plaque and gargle) and gastric samples. Of the 26 cases, 12 patients (46.1%) were positive for the H. pylori CagA gene in the oral samples, which was significantly lower than that in the gastric mucosa (80.8%; P = 0.010). The homology of the complete sequence alignment ranged from 74.0% to 92.1% in the oral and gastric samples. The V1 region alleles (positions 75-99) had 7-22 polymorphisms (homology from 12.0% to 72.0%) in 11 patients between the oral and gastric samples, but had 100% homology in 1 patient. Conclusions: Our study found that distinct H. pylori strains exist in the oral cavities of children, but we would not support the hypothesis that H. pylori in the oral cavities is an important reservoir of gastric H. pylori infections in children.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Therapy-induced cognitive impairment is prevalent and long-lasting in cancer survivors, but factors affecting post-therapy cognitive recovery are unclear. We conducted this study to evaluate the associations of age, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and physical activity (PA) with post-therapy cognitive changes in a population-based breast cancer (BC) survivor cohort. We collected information on PA, weight, height, waist and hip circumferences of 1286 BC survivors aged 20-75. We assessed their cognitive functions, including immediate memory, delayed memory, verbal fluency, and attention, at 18 and 36 months after cancer diagnosis. Linear regression models were used to examine the associations of age, BMI, WHR and PA with mean changes in cognitive scores from 18- to 36-month follow-up interview. We found that the post-therapy cognitive changes differed by age and obesity status. Verbal fluency and attention improved in younger patients aged <60 and non-abdominally obese patients, but deteriorated in older patients aged ≥60 (i.e. verbal fluency and attention) and abdominally obese patients (i.e. verbal fluency). Memory improved in all patients, with a smaller improvement in obese patients compared with normal-weight patients. No significant association was found between PA and post-therapy cognitive change. Due to the novelty of our findings and the limitations of our study, further research, including intervention trials, is warranted to confirm the causal relationship between obesity and cognitive impairments.',\n",

Captopril can reverse this progress.OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of captopril in reversing left ventricular remodeling in rats with pressure overload and to elucidate its possible mechanism.DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial.SETTING: Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Area Command of Chinese PLA; Shuguang Hospital affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Postdoctor Institute of Hebei Medical University. MATERIALS: The experiment was conducted in the Laboratory of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between January 1998 and October 1998. Totally 153 male Wistar rats were recruited. There were 5 experiments, 36 rats in each experiment except 9 rats in the fourth one. METHODS: A total of 36 Wistar male rats selected for each experiment were randomly divided into sham operation group, model group and captopril group. Rats in model group received modeling for 4 weeks, then gastric perfusion with 15 mL/kg of distilled water once per day for 4 consecutive weeks. Abdominal aorta of the rats in sham-operation group were separated without closure by sliver clip, then 4 weeks later the procedure was the same as that in model group. In captopril group, 4 weeks after modeling, the rats were performed gastric perfusion with diluted captopril of 100 mg/kg, once a day for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The effect of captopril on left ventricular mass index (LVMI), mRNA expression of collagen typeⅠand Ⅲ, content of plasma angiotensinⅡ(AngⅡ) and left ventricular tissue AngⅡ, plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and serum aldosterone (ALD) level.RESULTS: Totally 153 rats entered the result analysis. During the test for detecting the absorbance (A) of collagen typeⅠ, 3 rats in sham operation group and 3 in captopril group died, and 1 rat died in model group; finally 29 rats were involved. During the test for detecting the absorbance (A) of collagen type Ⅲ, 3 rats died in sham operation group, 4 rats died in model group, and 2 rats died in captopril group; finally 27 rats were involved. All the rats were lost due to operation injury. 1 Comparison of LVMI: LVMI in sham operation group and captopril group was lower than that in model group \\ue650(2.24±0.12)/1 000, (2.67±0.40) /1 000, (3.15±0.47)/1 000, t=2.649, 6.499, P < 0.001, 0.05 . 2 Change of A of collagen type I: It was significantly lower in sham operation group and captopril group than in model group \\ue650(0.57±0.19, 0.86±0.25, 2.79±2.00), t=3.661, 3.170, P < 0.01, 0.05 . 3 Change of A of collagen type Ⅲ: It was significantly lower in sham operation group and captopril group than in model group \\ue650(0.48±0.10, 0.52±0.29, 0.84±0.27), t=3.560, 2.417, P < 0.01, 0.05 . 4 The expression of mRNA of collagen type I: It was significantly lower in sham operation group and captopril group than in model group \\ue650(79.1±18.6)%, (51.7±16.0)%, (139.0±29.2)%, t=2.910, P < 0.05 . 5 Comparison of plasma AngⅡcontent: It was significantly lower in sham-operation group and captopril group than in model group \\ue650(130.2±30.2),(137.6±39.5),(196.7±48.6) μg/g, t=4.026, P < 0.01 . 6 Comparison of ALD level: It was significantly lower in sham operation group and captopril group than in model group \\ue650(170.6±51.6), (202.5±64.2), (339.3±115.4) μg/L, t=4.623, P < 0.01 . CONCLUSION: 1 Captopril decreased myocardial collagen typeⅠand type Ⅲ and mRNA expression in rats with pressure overload, suggesting its effect in reversing left ventricular remodeling. 2 The reversing effect of captopril on left ventricular remodeling might be related to decreasing circulating or local AngⅡ level, plasma ANF and serum aldosterone as well as affecting the expression of collagen typeⅠand type Ⅲ mRNA.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Very little is known about the effect of modifiable lifestyle factors on outcomes of triple-negative breast cancer. We examined this association in a population-based prospective cohort study of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: A total of 518 women with confirmed triple-negative breast cancer, recruited by the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, completed 6-, 18-, 36-, and 60-month postdiagnosis surveys. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the associations. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 53.4 (standard deviation = 10.6) years old. After a median follow-up of 9.1 years (range: 0.6-11.8), 128 deaths and 112 recurrences were documented. Exercise during the first 60 months postdiagnosis was inversely associated with total mortality and recurrence/disease-specific mortality with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.46, 0.96) and 0.58 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.86), respectively. Women with higher exercise-metabolic equivalent scores (7.6 metabolic equivalent-hours/week) and longer duration of exercise (2.5 hours/week) had lower risk of total and recurrence/disease-specific mortality than did nonexercisers. Compared with nontea drinkers, survival was better among women who were regular tea drinkers during the first 60 months for all cause (HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.93) and recurrence/disease-specific mortality (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31, 0.96). There was no dose-response pattern for tea consumption. No interactions were observed for body mass index, menopausal status, and comorbidity. Conclusions: These findings show that postdiagnosis exercise and tea intake were associated with improved survival among women with triple-negative breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Mixed results have been reported in recent epidemiologic studies in Western populations that have investigated the hypothesis that high glycemic load may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. This association has not been prospectively evaluated in other populations. Objective: We examined the association of overall glycemic index and glycemic load with colorectal cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Chinese women. Design: A total of 73,061 women aged 40-70 y and free of cancer at enrollment were included in this analysis. Usual dietary intake was assessed at baseline (1997-2000) and reassessed during the first follow-up (2000-2002) through in-person interviews by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Results: During an average follow-up of 9.1 y, 475 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified. Glycemic load was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (P for trend = 0.84). The multivariable hazard ratio for the highest compared with the lowest quintile of glycemic load was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.24). Similar results were also observed for associations with dietary glycemic index and total carbohydrate intake, and results did not vary by excluding individuals with a history of diabetes from the analysis. Conclusion: This prospective study, conducted in a population with a high intake of carbohydrates, provides no evidence that a high-glycemic index diet or high glycemic load is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

       "  'abstract': \"The synthesis and evaluation of 4 and 5, fully functionalized deglycobleomycin A(2) (2) analogues incorporating an oxazole and a pyrrole in place of the beta-hydroxy-L-histidine imidazole, are detailed, The oxazole agent is only capable of N-pi metal complexation through a form related to the N-1-H imidazole tautomer of bleomycin A(2) (1) while the pyrrole agent may potentially mimic the N-sigma metal complexation capabilities of the imidazole N-3-H tautomer. Metal complexes (Fe-II, Fe-III) of 4 and 5 were found to cleave duplex DNA in the presence of O-2 (Fe-II) or H2O2 (Fe-III). The oxazole agent 4 which is incapable of N-sigma metal chelation was found to behave analogous to, albeit slightly less effectively than, deglycobleomycin A(2) resulting in the characteristic 5'-GC/5'-GT sequence selective cleavage of duplex DNA directly confirming that imidazole/oxazole N-pi metal chelation is sufficient for functional reactivity. Importantly, the effective substitution of the oxazole O-1 for the histidine N-1 further illustrates that this group does not require deprotonation upon metal complexation, oxygen activation, or the ensuing oxidation reactions, that the functional bleomycin A(2) tautomer is the imidazole N-1-H tautomer, and that the imidazole N-1-H functionality is not contributing to the polynucleotide recognition through H-bonding to the phosphate backbone or nucleotide bases. In contrast, the pyrrole agent 5 which is incapable of N-pi metal chelation, but possesses the capabilities of functioning as a N-sigma metal donor was also found to cleave duplex DNA, but does so in a nonsequence selective fashion with a significantly reduced efficiency and a diminished double to single strand cleavage ratio both only slightly above that of background iron itself. These observations are analogous to those made with 3 which lacks the imidazole altogether and further support the observations that N-pi coordination, not N-sigma coordination, of the imidazole is required for the functional activity of bleomycin A(2).\",\n",

Our broad-spectrum Raman measurements identify optical and low-frequency shear modes in pseudo-1D o-TaS3 for the first time, and introduce their polarization resolved Raman responses to understand atomic vibrations for these modes. Results show that, unlike other anisotropic systems, only the S∥ mode at 54 cm–1 can be utilized to identify the crystalline orientation of TaS3. More notably, high-pressure Raman measurements reveal previously unknown four distinct types of responses to applied pressure, including positive, negative, and nonmonotonic dω/dP behaviors which are found to be closely linked to atomic vibrations for involving these modes. Our results also reveal that the material approaches an isotropic limit under applied pressure, evidenced by a significant reduction in the degree of anisotropy. O...',\n",

We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating.

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Remyelination disturbance is one of factors inducing functional handicap following spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the synergism of transplantation of controlled-release biomaterial of glial cell lined-derived neurotrophic factor on the myelin repair when transplantation with neuron-like cells derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) after spinal cord injury of macaca mulatta. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The randomized, controlled, animal study was performed at the Department of Pathology, Chuiyangliu Hospital, Beijing, China from May to July 2008. MATERIALS: Twelve spinal cord paraffin specimen of macaca mulatta were collected by professor Deng research team in Sun Yat-sen University from January 2004 to January 2005 as a retrospective experimental subjects. There were 3 groups, namely combined transplantation group, cell transplantation group and model control group, with 4 cases in each group. METHODS: Macaca mulatta BMSCs were isolated by the density gradient method. At passages 5-8, BMSCs were induced to differentiate into neurons. Severe acute spinal cord injury models were established in each group. In the combined transplantation group, BMSCs were preinduced using tanshinone for 1.5 hours at 10 days, and BMSCs-induced neuron-like cells (3.0×10 6/kg) were collected, mixed with methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) copolymer containing 2 μg gliocytes-derived neurotrophic factors, added with 200 μL phosphate buffer saline, and then made into suspension. The suspension was infused into 5 sites of the spinal cord injured regions. Samples in the cell transplantation group received phosphate buffer saline containing BMSCs-derived neurons-like cells induced by an equal volume of tanshinone. Samples in the model control group were subjected to the same volume of phosphate buffer saline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of hematoxylin-eosin staining and solochrome cyanine staining in corticospinal tract myelin sheath; mean absorbance of the myelin sheath. RESULTS: Remyelination was better in range and density of the repair on corticospinal tract myelin sheath in the combined transplantation group compared with the cell transplantation group based on solochrome cyanine staining, but not hematoxylin-eosin staining. Corticospinal tract structure was severely destroyed, without myelin sheath structure in the model control group. Image analysis results revealed that the mean absorbance was similar in the corticospinal tract myelin sheath between the combined transplantation group and cell transplantation group (t =1.725, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Controlled-release gliocytes-derived neurotrophic factors can enhance the repairing outcome of BMSCs-derived neuron-like cells on corticospinal tract myelin sheath of injured spinal cord of macaca mulatta.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most previous studies of meat intake and total or cause-specific mortality were conducted in North America, whereas studies in other areas have been limited and reported inconsistent results. This study investigated the association of red meat or poultry intake with risk of total and cause-specific mortality, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in two large population-based prospective cohort studies of 134,290 Chinese adult women and men in Shanghai. Meat intakes were assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires administered in person at baseline. Vital status and dates and causes of deaths were ascertained through annual linkage to the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry and Shanghai Cancer Registry databases and home visits every 2-3 years. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of death associated with quintiles of meat intake. During 803,265 person-years of follow up for women and 334,281 person-years of follow up for men, a total of 4,210 deaths in women and 2,733 deaths in men accrued. The median intakes of red meat were 43 g/day among women and 54 g/day among men, and pork constituted at least 95% of total meat intake for both women and men. Red meat intake was associated with increased total mortality among men, but not among women; the HR (95% CI) comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were 1.18 (1.02-1.35) and 0.92 (0.82-1.03), respectively. This sex difference was statistically significant (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.01). Red meat intake was associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality (HR\\u200a=\\u200a1.41, 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a1.05-1.89) and with decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke mortality (HR\\u200a=\\u200a0.62, 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a0.45-0.87). There were suggestive inverse associations of poultry intake with risk of total and all-CVD mortality among men, but not among women. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the sex-specific associations between red meat intake and mortality.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AIM: To observe the changes of RhoA and Rock1 expressions in rat myocardial tissues with pressure overload and to explore the protective effects of tanshinone ⅡA(Tan IIA) against myocardial hypertrophy.METHODS: Thirty-two Sprague Dawley(SD) rats induced by abdominal aorta constriction preparation were randomly divided into four groups(each n=8): model group(P<0.01),Tan ⅡA of low-dose group [L-Tan ⅡA group,10 mg/(kg·day)],Tan ⅡA of high-dose group [H-Tan IIA group,20 mg/(kg·day)],positive captopril group [captopril group,100 mg/(kg·day)] and age-matched SD sham-operated group(n=8) as control.The model of pressure overload-induced myocardial fibrosis was successfully established after 4 weeks of operation.After 4 weeks of Tan ⅡA treatment,heart mass indexes were estimated concurrently with evaluation of myocardial histology as well as myocardial hydroxyproline content by ELISA and immunohistochemistry staining and Western blot for myocardial RhoA and Rock1 content.RESULTS: Compared with those in sham group,heart mass indexes,myocardial hydroxyproline content and myocardial RhoA and Rock1 content were increased in the model group(P<0.01).Compared with those in model group,heart mass indexes,myocardial hydroxyproline content and myocardial RhoA and Rock1 content were decreased in the L-Tan ⅡA group(P<0.05),whereas these indexes were decreased significantly in the H-Tan ⅡA group(P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Expressions of RhoA and Rock1 protein significantly increase in pressure overload rat myocardium,indicating that RhoA/Rock signaling pathways are involved in pressure overload in rat cardiac hypertrophy and occurrence and development of cardiac hypertrophy in rats with pressure overload.Tan ⅡA can alleviate cardiac hypertrophy possibly by downregulation of the expression of RhoA/Rock signaling pathways.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Being diagnosed with breast cancer is a very stressful event that has a profound impact on multiple aspects of a patient's daily life. Little is known about the quality of life (QOL) of Chinese women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.The authors evaluated QOL in 2,236 Chinese women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were recruited into the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study between April 1, 2002 and March 31, 2004. Patients' QOL was assessed after cancer diagnosis (median time 6.4 months; range 3.6-11.1 months) by using the General Quality of Life Inventory. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the associations of QOL outcomes with medical and socio-demographic factors.Patients showed significantly worse overall QOL and perceived health status than healthy women, reflected mainly by lower QOL scores in physical and psychological well-being domains. Completion of radiotherapy, ever use of tamoxifen, being underweight, having an increased number of chronic diseases, and low household income were significantly associated with lower overall QOL scores after adjusting for other factors. Age at diagnosis was inversely associated with physical well-being, positively associated with material well-being, and had minimal influence on overall QOL. Stage of disease, chemotherapy, and education were only associated with certain domains, but had no influence on overall QOL. Estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status and type of surgery or immunotherapy did not appear to be associated with QOL.The findings of the present study provide important information on QOL and their correlates among Chinese women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and are helpful in developing treatment strategies accordingly.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of prediagnostic circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, with subsequent development of colorectal cancer. Prediagnostic plasma CRP levels were examined among 288 colorectal cancer cases and 576 individually-matched controls nested within the Shanghai Men's Health Study (2002-06), a population-based cohort study of 61 482 Chinese men. The association between CRP levels and colorectal cancer risk was investigated. Baseline plasma CRP levels were 53% higher among men who subsequently developed colorectal cancer than among those who remained free of the disease (1.15 versus 0.75 mu g/ml; P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed a dose-dependent relationship between CRP and colorectal cancer risk (P trend = 0.003); men in the highest tertile (CRP > 1.19 mu g/ml) had 1.88-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-2.86) increased odds of developing colorectal cancer compared with men in the lowest tertile (CRP < 0.45 mu g/ml). The association was only significant for colon cancer, when cancer site was considered, and was predominantly seen for cases diagnosed within 4 years of blood collection; adjusted odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest tertiles were 3.28 (95% CI: 1.28-8.37), 3.68 (95% CI: 1.62-8.38) and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.56-1.97), respectively, for cases diagnosed < 2, 2-4 and > 4 years after blood collection. The findings from our study suggest that circulating CRP level is positively associated with colorectal cancer risk in Chinese men, and this association, at least in part, is explained by inflammation-related cancerous or precancerous processes.\",\n",

Sequence variations in MTHFR (nucleotides 677 (C→T) and 1298 (A→C)) result in allozymes with decreased activity. The 677TT genotype is associated with increased toxicity of methotrexate and increased clinical response to 5-fluorouracil in treatment of cancers including breast cancer. We evaluated MTHFR genotypes and breast cancer survival in a cohort of 1067 Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 1998 who received surgery and chemotherapy. Life table method was used to calculate 5-year survival rates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Median follow-up time was 5.2\\xa0years; 5-year survival was 84.6%. Sixty-six percent carried a 677T allele and 31% carried a 1298 C allele. We found that overall 5-year breast cancer survival did not differ significantly across all genotypes (85.3% for 677 CC and 83.8% for 677TT; 83.8% for 1298 AA and 79.1% for 1298 CC). However, carrying the 677T allele was associated with non-significant increased risk of death for subjects with late stage disease (stages III–IV) (HR=1.80, 95% CI: 0.79–4.14 for TT vs. CC, p for trend=0.15), particularly among those who had survived past the second year (HR=2.97, 95% CI: 1.10–7.98, p for trend=0.04). The A1298C genotypes were not significantly associated with risk of death. This study suggests that the MTHFR C677T polymorphisms may affect long-term survival from advanced breast cancer.',\n",

In this new operator both the adaptive idea and scale space were fused into partial differential equations. Scale parameters were changed adaptively according to the presence or absence of noise in image which was detected by directional gradient operators with four templates. A new evaluating criterion was constructed to test the performance of the improved AMSS operators. Two parameters based on mean square error and minimum absolute error could be acquired to evaluate the effect of keeping edge information and the ability of smoothing noise.

       "  'abstract': \"Objective To explore the possible role of curcumin in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by investigating angiogengsis,expression of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in synovium of adjuvant arthritis rats. The expression of VEGF in blood serum was also detected. Methods 14 SD rats were divided into normal control group,model group,curcumin group and methotrexat group,modelling with Complete Freund's adjuvant. The rats of curcumin group were treated with 50 mg·kg-1·d-1 curcumin intraperitoneal injection continuously for 14 days and rats of methotrexat group were treated with 0.5 mg·kg-1·3d-1 methotrexat intraperitoneal injection for 5 times. The effects of treatment were monitored by measurement of arthritis index number(AI) at d9,d23. The expressions of VEGF in serum was detected by ELISA. Investigate synovium microvessels density and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 by immunohistochemical test. Results The arthritis index number of the rats injected CFA increased. Compared with normal group,the difference was significant(P<0.01) at d9. At d23,the AI of curcumin group and methotrexat group had significant difference compared with model group(P<0.01). The results of ELISA showed that curcumin and methotrexat can attenuate the degree of VEGF in serum(P<0.01). Immunohistochemical test showed that the expression of MVD,VEGF,VEGFR-2 had significant difference compared curcumin group and methotrexat group with model group(P<0.01),the difference between curcumin group and methotrexat group was not significant(P>0.05). Conclusion Curcumin can attenuate the degree of VEGF in serum,inhibit the expression VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the synovium and reduce MVD. It might be one of the machanism of curcuim in curing rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Circulating miRNAs as possible non-invasive biomarkers for disease risk assessment and cancer early diagnosis has attracted increasing interest. Little information, however, is available regarding the intra-individual variation of circulating miRNA levels. We measured miRNA expression in repeated plasma samples that were collected 6 to 12 months apart from 53 healthy individuals participating in a sub-study nested in the Shanghai Women9s and Shanghai Men9s Health Studies. Total RNA, including miRNA, was isolated from plasma using Qiagen9s miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit. Three synthetic spike-in RNA oligos (osa-miR414, cel-miR248, and ath-miR159a) were added to control for variances in the starting material and the efficiency of RNA extraction. NanoString9s Human v2 miRNA Expression Assay, which includes CodeSets of probes specific for 800 common human miRNAs, was used for the miRNA assays. The derived miRNA counts were first corrected by subtracting the background counts and then were normalized by using the average count from three spike-in oligos and  the top fifty miRNAs that gave most significant hybridization signals. The intra-individual variation was evaluated by an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). A total of 185 miRNAs were detected in at least 10% of samples. The detectable rate varied for each miRNA, with 69 and 44 miRNAs being detected in 50% and 75% of samples, respectively. The median ICC was 0.46 for all of the 185 detectable miRNAs. Among them, 41% (75 miRNAs) had an ICC ≥0.5, and 42 miRNAs had an ICC ≥0.6. The ICC is higher for miRNAs with higher expression levels and higher detection rates, when compared to their counterparts with lower expression or detection rates. In summary, we found that 185 miRNAs were expressed in at least 10% of plasma samples, and 69 miRNAs in 50% of samples from healthy Chinese men and women, and that 75 of these miRNAs had an ICC ≥0.5. These results suggest that common circulating miRNAs can serve as reliable biomarkers for epidemiological and clinical research.

In addition to possessing many physiologic functions, human growth hormone-1 (GH1) has been shown in recent in vitro and in vivo experiments to induce malignant disease, including breast carcinoma. The authors investigated the association of breast carcinoma with genetic polymorphisms in the GH1 gene in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. METHODS. Included in the current investigation were 1193 women with breast carcinoma (case patients) and 1310 healthy women from the same community (control patients) who completed in-person interviews and provided blood samples. Genetic polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region (nucleotide [m] -162 to nt +148 relative to the transcription start site of the GH1 gene) were searched and confirmed by resequencing DNA samples from 43 study participants. A novel polymorphism, a transition from adenine to guanine at or 69 (A69G), was identified. Samples from all participants were genotyped with TaqMan 5' nuclease assays for five common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-four in the proximal region (A-75G, G-57T, A-6G, and A69G) and one in intron 4 (T1169A). RESULTS. The frequencies of occurrence for the minor alleles in these polymorphic sites were 0.04, 0.60, 0.24, 0.03, and 0.34, respectively, in the control group; these frequencies were comparable to those observed in the case group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, none of the SNPs investigated in this study showed a statistically significant association with breast carcinoma risk. This null association was found for both younger women (age < 45 years) and older women (age greater than or equal to 45 years). GH1 gene haplotypes were assessed using SNP data and were analyzed in relation to breast carcinoma risk. Again, none of the haplotypes were associated with breast carcinoma risk. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the proximal promoter region and in the fourth intron of the GH1 gene are unrelated to breast carcinoma risk in Chinese women.

       "  'abstract': 'Context Soy foods are rich in isoflavones, a major group of phytoestrogens that have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, the estrogen-like effect of isoflavones and the potential interaction between isoflavones and tamoxifen have led to concern about soy food consumption among breast cancer patients. Objective To evaluate the association of soy food intake after diagnosis of breast cancer with total mortality and cancer recurrence. Design, Setting, and Participants The Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a large, population-based cohort study of 5042 female breast cancer survivors in China. Women aged 20 to 75 years with diagnoses between March 2002 and April 2006 were recruited and followed up through June 2009. Information on cancer diagnosis and treatment, lifestyle exposures after cancer diagnosis, and disease progression was collected at approximately 6 months after cancer diagnosis and was reassessed at 3 follow-up interviews conducted at 18, 36, and 60 months after diagnosis. Annual record linkage with the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry database was carried out to obtain survival information for participants who were lost to follow-up. Medical charts were reviewed to verify disease and treatment information. Main Outcome Measures Total mortality and breast cancer recurrence or breast cancer-related deaths. Cox regression analysis was carried out with adjustment for known clinical predictors and other lifestyle factors. Soy food intake was treated as a time-dependent variable. Results During the median follow-up of 3.9 years (range, 0.5-6.2 years), 444 deaths and 534 recurrences or breast cancer-related deaths were documented in 5033 surgically treated breast cancer patients. Soy food intake, as measured by either soy protein or soy isoflavone intake, was inversely associated with mortality and recurrence. The hazard ratio associated with the highest quartile of soy protein intake was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.92) for total mortality and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54-0.87) for recurrence compared with the lowest quartile of intake. The multivariate-adjusted 4-year mortality rates were 10.3% and 7.4%, and the 4-year recurrence rates were 11.2% and 8.0%, respectively, for women in the lowest and highest quartiles of soy protein intake. The inverse association was evident among women with either estrogen receptor-positive or-negative breast cancer and was present in both users and nonusers of tamoxifen. Conclusion Among women with breast cancer, soy food consumption was significantly associated with decreased risk of death and recurrence. JAMA. 2009; 302(22): 2437-2443',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cumulative evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factors (IGF) play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. The IGF binding proteins regulate the action of IGFs, and >90% of circulating IGFs are bound to IGFBP-3. We evaluated the associations of five (A-202C, G227C, C3804G, 5606InsA, and C5827T) genetic polymorphisms in the IGFBP3 gene with breast cancer risk and the blood IGFBP-3 protein level in a population-based, case-control study conducted among Chinese women in Shanghai. Genomic DNA samples from 1,193 incident breast cancer patients and 1,310 community controls were genotyped for IGFBP3 polymorphisms. Blood IGFBP-3 levels were determined for 390 controls. A 30% to 60% elevated risk of breast cancer was found to be associated with homozygosity for the variant allele in polymorphisms A-202C, G227C, 5606InsA, and C5827T. Carrying the variant allele in C3804G was also associated with an increased risk. About 13.5% of cases and 9.7% of controls had one or more of the above risk genotypes, resulting in odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of 1.4 (1.0-1.9). The ORs (95% CIs) were 1.3 (1.0-1.8) and 1.7 (1.1-2.5) for women with one to two and three to five risk genotypes, respectively (P for trend < 0.01). Four common haplotypes for the IGFBP3 gene were identified. Compared with the haplotype containing only the wild-type allele in the five loci, the haplotype with the variant allele in all sites was associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9), particularly among younger women (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.9). With the exception of C3804G, in which no homozygote was identified, the level of circulating IGFBP-3 was reduced in a dose-response manner with an increasing number of variant alleles in each of the other four polymorphic sites (P for trend < 0.05). These results indicated that IGFBP3 polymorphisms may be associated with the level of blood IGFBP-3 protein and an increased risk of breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Transition metal monochalcogenides comprise a class of two-dimensional materials with electronic band gaps that are highly sensitive to material thickness and chemical composition. Here, we explore the tunability of the electronic excitation spectrum in GaSe using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The electronic structure of the material is modified by $\\\\textit{in-situ}$ potassium deposition as well as by forming GaS$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ alloy compounds. We find that potassium decouples the top-most tetra-layer of the GaSe unit cell, leading to a substantial change of the dispersion around the valence band maximum (VBM). The observed band dispersion of a single tetralayer is consistent with a transition from the direct gap character of the bulk to the indirect gap character expected for monolayer GaSe. Upon alloying with sulfur, we observe a phase transition from AB to $\\\\text{AA}^{\\\\prime}$ stacking. Alloying also results in a rigid energy shift of the VBM towards higher binding energies which correlates with a blue shift in the luminescence. The increase of the band gap upon sulfur alloying does not appear to change the dispersion or character of the VBM appreciably, implying that it is possible to engineer the gap of these materials while maintaining their salient electronic properties.

The project comprises three 60 MVA converters and is applied to a 220 kV ac system. The installation of the project is reported in this paper, including the optimized structure and the layout. Besides, the UPFC systemlevel control strategy is discussed. With the proposed system-level control strategy, a key transmission section of the Nanjing Western Power Grid will be operated at the preset operating point under the normal condition. While, the power flows of the transmission lines in the transmission section can be controlled within the line loading limits under fault conditions. The commissioning test results of the Nanjing UPFC project and the proposed system-level control strategy are also presented. The waveforms recorded show that the project performs well under the normal operation condition and the fault conditions. The security of the Nanjing Western Power Grid is enhanced by the installation of the Nanjing UPFC project.',\n",

The studies illustrate that N-methylation of the L-threonine subunit within deglycobleomycin A(2) dramatically reduces the DNA cleavage efficiency (10-15-fold), weakens and nearly abolishes the inherent DNA cleavage selectivity, but has little effect on the inherent oxidation capabilities of the activated Fe(III) complexes.

Included in this analysis were 72 773 nonsmoking women who had anthropometrics taken by trained interviewers at enrollment and who were followed up through December 31, 2004. Deaths were ascertained by biennial home visits and linkage with the vital statistics registry.During a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, 1456 deaths occurred. The waist-hip ratio was positively and significantly associated with deaths from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (P<.01 for trend).

After adjustment for body mass index and other potential confounders, the relative risks of total mortality were 1 (reference group), 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.58), 1.40 (95% CI, 1.14-1.72), 1.54 (95% CI, 1.26-1.88), and 1.95 (95% CI, 1.60-2.38) across the lowest to the highest waist-hip ratio quintiles. The positive association appeared to be more evident in women with a lower body mass index. The relative risks of total mortality comparing the extreme waist-hip ratio quintiles were 2.36 (95% CI, 1.71-3.27), 1.60 (95% CI, 1.10-2.34), and 1.46 (95% CI, 0.97-2.20) for women with a body mass index of less than 22.3, 22.3 to 25.1, and 25.2 or greater, respectively.Abdominal adiposity independently predicts mortality risk, particularly for nonobese women.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The synthesis and evaluation of 4 and 5, fully functionalized deglycobleomycin A(2) (2) analogues incorporating an oxazole and a pyrrole in place of the beta-hydroxy-L-histidine imidazole, are detailed, The oxazole agent is only capable of N-pi metal complexation through a form related to the N-1-H imidazole tautomer of bleomycin A(2) (1) while the pyrrole agent may potentially mimic the N-sigma metal complexation capabilities of the imidazole N-3-H tautomer. Metal complexes (Fe-II, Fe-III) of 4 and 5 were found to cleave duplex DNA in the presence of O-2 (Fe-II) or H2O2 (Fe-III). The oxazole agent 4 which is incapable of N-sigma metal chelation was found to behave analogous to, albeit slightly less effectively than, deglycobleomycin A(2) resulting in the characteristic 5'-GC/5'-GT sequence selective cleavage of duplex DNA directly confirming that imidazole/oxazole N-pi metal chelation is sufficient for functional reactivity. Importantly, the effective substitution of the oxazole O-1 for the histidine N-1 further illustrates that this group does not require deprotonation upon metal complexation, oxygen activation, or the ensuing oxidation reactions, that the functional bleomycin A(2) tautomer is the imidazole N-1-H tautomer, and that the imidazole N-1-H functionality is not contributing to the polynucleotide recognition through H-bonding to the phosphate backbone or nucleotide bases. In contrast, the pyrrole agent 5 which is incapable of N-pi metal chelation, but possesses the capabilities of functioning as a N-sigma metal donor was also found to cleave duplex DNA, but does so in a nonsequence selective fashion with a significantly reduced efficiency and a diminished double to single strand cleavage ratio both only slightly above that of background iron itself. These observations are analogous to those made with 3 which lacks the imidazole altogether and further support the observations that N-pi coordination, not N-sigma coordination, of the imidazole is required for the functional activity of bleomycin A(2).\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although genetic variations in cell-cycle control genes have been previously linked to cancer risk, no study has specifically evaluated the role of these gene variants in endometrial carcinogenesis. Using data from the Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study with 1,199 cases and 1,212 age-matched controls (1997-2003), the authors carried out a systematic evaluation of the association of cell-cycle control genes with endometrial cancer risk. Sixty-five tagging or potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CCNB1, CCND1, CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN2A genes were genotyped and evaluated. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDKN1B gene (rs11055027, rs3759216, and rs34330) were related to endometrial cancer risk, although only the association with rs34330 remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The odds ratios for rs34330 were 1.33 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.66) and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.94) for the CT and TT genotypes, respectively, compared with the CC genotype. In vitro luciferase reporter assays showed that the minor allele (A) in rs3759216, which was associated with decreased endometrial cancer risk (odds ratio = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.94) without adjustment for multiple comparisons, significantly increased promoter activity. These findings suggest that polymorphisms of the CDKN1B gene may play a role in endometrial carcinogenesis.',\n",

Design A pooled analysis of 15 population-based cohort studies. Setting and participants 694434 Asian individuals from 15 prospective cohorts within the Asia Cohort Consortium. Interventions None. Main outcome measures HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause mortality, as well as for CVD-specific mortality and cancer-specific mortality. Results A total of 694434 participants (mean age at baseline=53.2 years) were included in the analysis. During a mean follow-up period of 12.5 years, 103023 deaths were observed, among which 33939 were due to cancer and 34645 were due to CVD. Higher educational levels were significantly associated with lower risk of death from all causes compared with a low educational level (<= primary education); HRs and 95% CIs for secondary education, trade/technical education and >= university education were 0.88 (0.85 to 0.92), 0.81 (0.73 to 0.90) and 0.71 (0.63 to 0.80), respectively (p(trend)=0.002).

Methods Twenty-four male lewis rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control group, model group, PNS group and DM group. AA rat models were established by intradermal injection of Complete Freund′s adjuvant. Polyarthritis indices were scored. Pathological sections of ankle joint in rats were made and then stained by HE method and immunohistochemical method respectively. Infiltration of inflammatory cell and hyperplasia of synovioblast in HE-stained pathological sections were observed under microscope and expression of NF-κB was observed by semi-quantitative immunohistochemical method. Results PNS were given to rats by intraperitoneal injection for 2 weeks after immunization. Compared with AA model group, the polyarthritic symptoms of PNS group rats were improved significantly (P < 0.05), infiltration of inflammatory cell of PNS group rats was improved significantly in HE-stained pathological sections (P < 0.05) and expression of NF-κB of PNS group was decreased in pathological sections stained by immunohistochemical method (P < 0.05).

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Although cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol drinking, obesity, and several other well-studied unhealthy lifestyle-related factors each have been linked to the risk of multiple chronic diseases and premature death, little is known about the combined impact on mortality outcomes, in particular among Chinese and other non-Western populations. The objective of this study was to quantify the overall impact of lifestyle-related factors beyond that of active cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Chinese women. Methods and Findings: We used data from the Shanghai Women's Health Study, an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study in China. Participants included 71,243 women aged 40 to 70 years enrolled during 1996-2000 who never smoked or drank alcohol regularly. A healthy lifestyle score was created on the basis of five lifestyle-related factors shown to be independently associated with mortality outcomes (normal weight, lower waist-hip ratio, daily exercise, never exposed to spouse's smoking, higher daily fruit and vegetable intake). The score ranged from zero (least healthy) to five (most healthy) points. During an average follow-up of 9 years, 2,860 deaths occurred, including 775 from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 1,351 from cancer. Adjusted hazard ratios for mortality decreased progressively with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle factors. Compared to women with a score of zero, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for women with four to five factors were 0.57 (0.44-0.74) for total mortality, 0.29 (0.16-0.54) for CVD mortality, and 0.76 (0.54-1.06) for cancer mortality. The inverse association between the healthy lifestyle score and mortality was seen consistently regardless of chronic disease status at baseline. The population attributable risks for not having 4-5 healthy lifestyle factors were 33% for total deaths, 59% for CVD deaths, and 19% for cancer deaths. Conclusions: In this first study, to our knowledge, to quantify the combined impact of lifestyle-related factors on mortality outcomes in Chinese women, a healthier lifestyle pattern-including being of normal weight, lower central adiposity, participation in physical activity, nonexposure to spousal smoking, and higher fruit and vegetable intake-was associated with reductions in total and cause-specific mortality among lifetime nonsmoking and nondrinking women, supporting the importance of overall lifestyle modification in disease prevention.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Only two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to date to identify potential markers for total mortality after diagnosis of breast cancer. Here, we report the identification of two singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with total mortality from a two-stage GWAS conducted among 6,110 Shanghai-resident Chinese women with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I to IV breast cancer. The discovery stage included 1,950 patients and evaluated 613,031 common SNPs. The top 49 associations were evaluated in an independent replication stage of 4,160 Shanghai patients with breast cancer. A consistent and highly significant association with total mortality was documented for SNPs rs3784099 and rs9934948. SNP rs3784099, located in the RAD51L1 gene, was associated with total morality in both the discovery stage (P = 1.44 × 10 -8) and replication stage (P = 0.06; P-combined = 1.17 × 10 -7). Adjusted HRs for total mortality were 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.68] for the AG genotype and 2.64 (95% CI, 1.74-4.03) for the AA genotype, when compared with the GG genotype. The variant C allele of rs9934948, located on chromosome 16, was associated with a similarly elevated risk of total mortality (P-combined = 5.75 × 10 -6). We also observed this association among 1,145 patients with breast cancer of European ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; P = 0.006); the association was highly significant in a combined analysis of NHS and Chinese data (P = 1.39 × 10 -7). Similar associations were observed for these two SNPs with breast cancer-specific mortality. This study provides strong evidence suggesting that the RAD51L1 gene and a chromosome 16 locus influence breast cancer prognosis. ©2012 AACR.\",\n",

We prospectively investigated the associations of plasma levels of tocopherols, retinol, carotenoids with the risk of developing breast cancer among Chinese women. We conducted a study of 365 incident breast cancer cases and 726 individually matched controls nested within a large cohort study of women aged 40-70 years at baseline. We observed no associations between breast cancer risk and any of the tocopherols, retinol, and most carotenoids. However, high levels of plasma lycopene other than trans, 5- and 7-cis or trans alpha-cryptoxanthin were inversely associated with the risk of developing breast cancer. Our results do not support an overall protective effect of lipophilic antioxidants on breast cancer risk.

       "  'abstract': 'Large-scale synthesis of van der Waals (vdW) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with controlled crystallinity and interlayer coupling strength is one of the bottlenecks in 2D materials that has limited its successful transition to large-scale applications. Here, scalable synthesis of mBDC (m = Zn and Cu) 2D MOFs at large scales through a biphase method is demonstrated. The results show replacing water molecules with pyridine eliminates hydrogen bond formation at metal cluster sites. This prohibits tight coupling across adjacent MOF layers and sustains controllable 2D vdW MOF growth. It is further shown that control over the growth speed, crystallinity, and thickness can be achieved by addition of a controlled amount of triethylamine and formic acid to achieve highly crystalline vdW MOF nanosheets with extraordinarily high aspect ratio. The described synthesis route can easily be scaled up for large-scale production either by deposition onto desired substrates or in crystalline layered powder form. Owing to its large lateral size, vdW nature, and high crystallinity, it is possible to perform atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and Raman measurements on the 2D MOFs. The results not only establish their vibrational properties and layer-dependent responses but also show striking differences from other 2D inorganic materials.',\n",

Among them, 12 metabolites were glycerophospholipids including nine associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer and three with increased risk [odds ratios (ORs) per standard deviation (SD) increase of transformed metabolites: 0.31 to 1.98; p values: 0.002 to 1.25 × 10 ]. The other 23 metabolites associated with colorectal cancer risk included nine lipids other than glycerophospholipid, seven aromatic compounds, five organic acids, and four other organic compounds. After mutual adjustment, nine metabolites remained statistically significant for colorectal cancer. Together, these independently associated metabolites can separate cancer cases from controls with an area under the curve of 0.76 for colorectal cancer. We have identified that dysregulation of glycerophospholipids may contribute to risk of colorectal cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent evidence suggests that urinary F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs) are more accurate markers of oxidative stress than other available biomarkers. Most previous studies used unmetabolized F(2)-IsoPs as a biomarker. Few previous studies measured 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M, a metabolite of one of the most common F(2)-IsoPs, 15-F(2t)-IsoP. Unlike 15-F(2t)-IsoP, 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M is not subject to autoxidation and renal production. To our knowledge, no study has compared the associations of age and body mass index (BMI) with F(2)-IsoPs to those with 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M. Urinary levels of F(2)-IsoPs and 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 845 healthy women aged 40-70 years. Both F(2)-IsoPs and 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M were elevated among smokers. The level of 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M increased with age, particularly after menopause, and with BMI. In contrast, F(2)-IsoPs decreased with age, regardless of menopausal status, and was not related to BMI. The association of 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M with age or menopausal status did not differ by BMI category, and the association with BMI was also independent of age or menopausal status. 15-F(2t)-IsoP-M appears to be a valuable biomarker of oxidative stress in age-and obesity-related diseases.

The voltage magnitudes of the ac buses are monitored in real-time operation and are controlled within their limits by the adjustment of the reactive power setting of the series converter. Firstly, the sensitivity of the voltage magnitudes of ac buses to the adjustment the reactive power setting of the series converter is deduced. Secondly, the control scheme of the bus voltage regulation is developed, which adjusts the reactive power setting of the series converter intelligently when the bus voltage limits are violated. Otherwise, the reactive power setting is kept at the value given by the control center. The validity of the proposed control scheme and the voltage sensitivity analysis is proved by the case study in IEEE 39-bus system.

       "  'abstract': 'Cruciferous vegetables are a major source of glucosinolate-derived bioactive compounds such as isothiocyanates, which have been shown in animal and in vitro studies to inhibit cancer growth and progression. Few studies have investigated cruciferous vegetable intake after diagnosis and breast cancer outcomes. Using data from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project, which includes prospective data from U. S. and Chinese breast cancer survivors, we evaluated the association of cruciferous vegetables with breast cancer outcomes. Analyses included 11,390 women diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast cancer (1990-2006) from four cohorts. Cruciferous vegetable intake (g/day) was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (mean of 22 months postdiagnosis). Study heterogeneity was evaluated by the Q statistic; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using delayed-entry Cox regression models stratified by study. After a median follow-up of 9.0 years, 1,725 deaths and 1,421 recurrences were documented. In pooled analyses using study-specific quartiles, cruciferous vegetable intake was not associated with breast cancer outcomes, adjusting for known clinical prognostic factors and selected lifestyle factors. HRs (95% CIs) by increasing quartiles (reference = lowest quartile) were 1.08 (0.93-1.25), 1.01 (0.87-1.18), and 1.10 (0.95-1.28) for recurrence (P-trend = 0.34) and 1.01 (0.88-1.15), 0.97 (0.84-1.11), and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for total mortality (P-trend = 0.84). No associations were observed for subgroups defined by estrogen receptor status, stage, or tamoxifen therapy. Cruciferous vegetable intake at approximately two years after diagnosis was not associated with recurrence or mortality. Our results do not support an association between postdiagnosis cruciferous vegetable intake and breast cancer outcomes. (C) 2013 AACR.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: To date, few epidemiologic studies have been conducted to elucidate lifestyle-related risk factors for multiple myeloma in Asia. We investigated the association of body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol intake with the risk of multiple myeloma mortality through a pooled analysis of more than 800,000 participants in the Asia Cohort Consortium. Methods: The analysis included 805,309 participants contributing 10,221,623 person-years of accumulated follow-up across Asia Cohort Consortium cohorts. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between BMI, smoking, and alcohol at baseline and the risk of multiple myeloma mortalitywere assessed using aCox proportional hazardsmodel with shared frailty. Results: We observed a statistically significant dose-dependent association between BMI categories and the risk of multiple myeloma mortality (<18.5 kg/m(2): HR = 0.80,95% CI: 0.52-1.24; 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2): reference; 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2): HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.47; >= 30 kg/m(2): HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.99-2.64, P-trend = 0.014). By sex, this association was more apparent in women than in men (P for heterogeneity between sexes = 0.150). We observed no significant associations between smoking or alcohol consumption and risk of multiple myeloma mortality. Conclusions: This study showed that excess body mass is associated with an increased risk of multiple myeloma mortality among Asian populations. In contrast, our results do not support an association between smoking or alcohol consumption and the risk of multiple myeloma mortality in Asian populations. Impact: This study provides important evidence on the association of BMI, smoking, and alcohol with the risk of multiple myeloma mortality in Asian populations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The impact of some prognostic factors on breast cancer survival has been shown to vary with time since diagnosis. However, this phenomenon has not been evaluated in Asians. In the present study, 4886 patients were recruited from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a longitudinal study of patients diagnosed during 2002-2006, with a median follow-up time of 11.2 years. Cox model incorporating time-by-covariate interactions was used to describe the time-varying effects of prognostic factors related to overall survival and disease-free survival. Age >= 65 years showed a progressively negative effect on breast cancer prognosis over time, whereas tumour size >2cm had a lasting and constant impact. Age significantly modified the effects of the tumour grade, nodal status and oestrogen receptor (ER) status on breast cancer survival. The detrimental effect of poorly differentiated tumours was time limited and more obvious in patients aged 45-54 years. Having >= 4 positive lymph nodes had a persistent and negative impact on prognosis, although it attenuated in later years; the phenomenon was more prominent in the 55-64-year age group. ER-positive status was protective in the first 3 years after diagnosis but was related to a higher risk of recurrence in later years; the time-point when ER-positive status turned into a risk factor was earlier in younger patients. These results suggest that older age, positive lymph node status, larger tumour size and ER-positive status are responsible for late death or recurrence in Asian breast cancer survivors. Extended endocrine therapy should be given earlier in younger ER-positive patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Controversy exists regarding the role of dietary fat in breast cancer etiology. We investigated the association of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the ratio of n-6 PUFAs to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs with breast cancer risk in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study including 72,571 cancer-free participants at baseline. Dietary fatty acid intake was determined using food frequency questionnaires. We used Cox proportional hazards analysis to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of breast cancer risk with dietary fatty acids consumption. In 583,998 person-years of follow-up, we identified 712 breast cancer cases. We found no association of breast cancer risk to dietary intake of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, α-linolenic acid or marine-derived n-3 PUFA. We found a statistically significant interaction between n-6 PUFA intake, marine-derived n-3 PUFA intake and breast cancer risk (p = 0.008). Women with lower intake (the lowest tertile) of marine-derived n-3 PUFA and higher intake (the highest tertile) of n-6 PUFA had an increase risk for breast cancer (RR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.27-3.34) compared to women with higher intake (the highest tertile) of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs and lower intake (the lowest tertile) of n-6 PUFAs after adjusting for potential confounders. The relative amounts of n-6 PUFA to marine-derived n-3 PUFAs may be more important for breast cancer risk than individual dietary amounts of these fatty acids. Copyright © 2010 UICC.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In order to fuse efficiently the multi-channel information of the target and improve the performance of the filter, a new class of k-mask based hyper-connectivity was proposed. The connectivity mask image and the reconstruct mask image were obtained from the different channel informations and restraint conditions. According to the area information by which the connectivity mask image intersects the reconstruct mask image, the connected components in the reconstruct mask image were relabeled to form the new connection space by selection and aggregation. From the definition of the hyper-connectivity class, k-mask based hyper-connected open operator and reconstruct operator were designed and applied in labeling the character region and extracting the major path of the remote sensing image. Experiment results illustrated that the filter performance of the traditional open operator and reconstruction operator was improved significantly by flexible selection of the connectivity mask image and fusion of the image multi-gradient information, color information and multi-channel information.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This study aimed to investigate the enhanced protoscolicidal effect of high intensity focused ultrasound(HIFU) combined with superabsorbent resin(SAR).The fresh hydatid cysts within the sheep liver measured at a diameter of 4.5-5 cm were randomly and equally divided into 6 groups: blank control group(group Ⅰ,no SAR in the cyst,no HIFU duration);SAR at a dose of half-saturation and saturation respectively(group Ⅱ and Ⅲ,no HIFU duration);HIFU experimental control groups(group Ⅳ,irradiated with HIFU only);the test groups(groupⅤ,treated with same HIFU power and SAR at a dose of half-saturation);saturation(group Ⅵ,the particles of SAR were injected into the cysts before the irradiation of HIFU).The irradiation power of experimental control groups was 200 w and the target was monitored by real-time B ultrasound.Just after the irradiation with HIFU,the temperature of hydatid fluid,cyst wall and the hepatic tissues around cysts were measured accordingly,and the instant death rates of protoscolices of hydatid fluid were determined by trypan blue exclusion assay.After HIFU irradiation,the temperatures of cyst wall,hydatid fluids and the hepatic tissues around cysts increased respectively.There were significant differences between the HIFU irradiation experimental groups and the control groups(P<0.05).In the HIFU treated group with SAR at a dose of half-saturation,the average temperature of cyst wall,cyst fluid,and adjacent hepatic tissues around cysts was(49±0.87)℃,(38.9±1.02)℃,and(34.5±0.88)℃,respectively.But in the HIFU treated group with SAR at a dose of saturation,the average temperature of above mentioned locations was(55±0.81)℃,(44.6±1.82)℃,and(37.88±0.67)℃,respectively.The death rate from Ⅰ to Ⅵ group was 22.94%,23.11%,24.43%,55.28%,63.4%,and 74.2%,respectively(P<0.05).It'S suggested that the combination of SAR and HIFU could increase the temperatures of the cyst wall and cyst fluid compared to those treated with HIFU only,so as to enhance the protoscolicidal effect of HIFU to the protoscolices in cyst fluid.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of body mass index (BMI), weight change on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) prognosis in a population-based prospective cohort study. The current analysis included 518 participants diagnosed with TNBC in Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study. Weight at 1\\xa0year prior to cancer diagnosis, at diagnosis, and at 6, 18 and 36 months after cancer diagnosis and height at 6\\xa0months after cancer diagnosis were assessed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in relation to BMI and weight change using Cox proportional hazard models. Obesity (BMI\\xa0≥\\xa028.0\\xa0kg/m2) at 1-year pre-diagnosis was associated with higher risk of total mortality and recurrence/disease-specific mortality, with multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.79 (95\\xa0% CI 1.06–3.03) and 1.83 (95\\xa0% CI 1.05–3.21), respectively. The associations between BMI and TNBC prognosis attenuated over time from pre-diagnosis to post-diagnosis. Compared with stable weight (change within 5\\xa0%), weight loss ≥5\\xa0% at 18- or 36-month post-diagnosis was related with higher risk of total mortality and recurrence/disease-specific mortality. Respective multivariate HRs were 2.08 (95\\xa0% CI 1.25–3.46) and 1.42 (95\\xa0% CI 0.77–2.63) for OS, and 2.50 (95\\xa0% CI 1.454.30) and 2.17 (95\\xa0% CI 1.14–4.12) for DFS. However, the association of weight loss and OS/DFS attenuated after excluding patients whose weight was measured after recurrence. Weight gain ≥5\\xa0% at 18- or 36-month post-diagnosis was associated with a non-significant increased risk of death. The results showed that obesity pre-diagnosis and weight loss post-diagnosis was inversely associated with TNBC prognosis. Emphasis on maintaining stable weight after cancer diagnosis for TNBC patients may be considered.',\n",

We evaluated this polymorphism\\n in association with breast cancer in a group of women who participated in a large-scale, population-based, case-control study\\n of breast cancer in Shanghai, China, followed by an in\\xa0vitro analysis of the function of this polymorphism. Genomic DNA from\\n 3,012 patients with breast cancer and 3,004 healthy controls was examined for the Ile655Val polymorphism using a TaqMan genotyping method. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were derived from multiple logistic regression.\\n In\\xa0vitro analyses were carried out to examine whether the Ile655Val polymorphism affect ERBB2 expression and the activity of its downstream targets. Approximately 2% of study subjects carry the Val/Val genotype. Compared\\n with women with the Ile/Ile (76%) genotype, women who had the Ile/Val (22%) or Val/Val genotype did not have an elevated risk\\n of breast cancer. Stratified analyses by age and menopausal status revealed no apparent association with this polymorphism\\n in any subgroups of women. In a serious of biochemical analyses, we found that the Ile655Val substitution did not alter ErbB2 and its downstream signaling molecule activity.

With differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and allele frequencies between ancestry groups, studies in additional large samples may detect new associations. We conducted staged GWAS meta-analyses in up to 69,414 East Asian individuals from 24 studies with participants from Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. These meta-analyses identified (P < 5 x 10(-8)) three novel loci associated with HDL-C near CD163-APOBEC1 (P = 7.4 x 10(-9)), NCOA2 (P = 1.6 x 10(-8)), and NID2-PTGDR (P = 4.2 x 10(-8)), and one novel locus associated with TG near WDR11-FGFR2 (P = 2.7 x 10(-10)). Conditional analyses identified a second signal near CD163-APOBEC1. We then combined results from the East Asian meta-analysis with association results from up to 187,365 European individuals from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium in a trans-ancestry meta-analysis. This analysis identified (log(10)Bayes Factor a 6.1) eight additional novel lipid loci. Among the twelve total loci identified, the index variants at eight loci have demonstrated at least nominal significance with other metabolic traits in prior studies, and two loci exhibited coincident eQTLs (P < 1 x 10(-5)) in subcutaneous adipose tissue for BPTF and PDGFC.

       "  'abstract': \"Objective: Modifiable factors predicting the onset of menopause, a transition with important implications for women's health, have not been fully characterized. We evaluated the impact of dietary, lifestyle and reproductive factors on age at natural menopause and reproductive span in Chinese women. Design: Study participants were Chinese women aged 40 to 70 who experienced natural menopause and participated in a population-based, prospective study, the Shanghai Women's Health Study (N = 33,054). Dietary intake at the baseline survey was assessed by food-frequency questionnaire. Regression (P) coefficients, calculated by multivariable linear regression, were used to estimate the effects of dietary, lifestyle, and reproductive patterns on age at menopause and the number of reproductive years, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: Early menarche, younger age at first live birth, older age at last live birth, longer duration of breast-feeding, and higher parity were associated with longer reproductive years (P-trend < 0.01 for all). Higher body mass index at age 20, mid-life weight gain, and leisure-time physical activity during adolescence and adulthood predicted later menopause and longer reproductive span (P-trend < 0.01 for all). Total intake of calories, fruits, and protein was positively associated with later menopause (P-trend < 0.05 for all) and longer reproductive span (P-trend < 0.05), except for carbohydrates (P-trend = 0.06), and long-term tea consumption predicted longer reproductive span (P-trend = 0.03). Vegetable, fat, soy, and fiber intakes did not significantly affect reproductive span or age at menopause. Smoking was inversely assoicated with both early age at menopause and shorter reproductive span (P-trend < 0.01). Conclusions: In addition to reproductive factors, intake of fruits and protein, smoking, tea consumption, lifetime patterns of physical activity, and weight gain influenced the onset of menopause and/or reproductive span in Chinese women.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids, found mainly in fish, have been postulated to reduce type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. However, the role of long-chain n-3 fatty acids and fish intake in the development of T2D remains unresolved. Objective: We examined associations between fish, shellfish, and long-chain n-3 fatty acids and the risk of T2D in a middle-aged Chinese population. Design: This was a prospective population-based cohort study in 51,963 men and 64,193 women free of T2D, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at baseline with valid dietary information. Dietary intake, physical activity, and anthropometric measurements were collected. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the association of fish, shellfish, and long-chain n-3 fatty acid (in g/d) with risk of T2D. Results: Fish, shellfish, and long-chain n-3 fatty acid intakes were inversely associated with T2D in women. The relative risks [RRs (95% CI)] for quintiles of fish intake were 1.00, 0.96 (0.86, 1.06), 0.84 (0.75, 0.94), 0.80 (0.71, 0.90), and 0.89 (0.78, 1.01) (P for trend = 0.003) and for shellfish were 1.00, 0.91 (0.82, 1.01), 0.79 (0.71, 0.89), 0.80 (0.71, 0.91), and 0.86 (0.76, 0.99) (P for trend = 0.006). In men, only the association between shellfish intake and T2D was significant. The RRs (95% CI) for quintiles of fish intake were 1.00, 0.92 (0.75, 1.13), 0.80 (0.65, 1.00), 0.89 (0.72, 1.11), and 0.94 (0.74, 1.17) (P for trend = 0.50) and for shellfish intake were 1.00, 0.93 (0.76, 1.12), 0.70 (0.56, 086), 0.66 (0.53, 0.82), and 0.82 (0.65, 1.02) (P for trend = 0.003). Conclusions: An inverse association between fish and shellfish intake and T2D in women was found. No evidence of a detrimental effect of fish intake in this population was observed.

       "  'abstract': \"Dietary patterns, which reflect the complexity of food preference, lifestyle and socio-economic status, may play a major role in health and longevity. Understanding dietary patterns and their correlates is important to the research of diet and health relationships. In the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS) a total of 61582 men aged 40-74 were recruited between 2002 and 2006. Their food intake over the previous year was collected using a validated FFQ. Study participants (75.6 %) reported little or no change in meat and vegetable intake in the 5 years prior to recruitment. Using the baseline data of the SMHS, we assessed dietary patterns, as well as their relationship with socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and with prevalence of some chronic diseases. Three major dietary patterns, fruit-, vegetable- and meat-based diets, were identified in our population. Consumption of the fruit diet appeared to be more common among men who were older and more physically active, had higher income, and lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), while this diet was less common among manual labourers. The meat- or vegetable-based diets were less common among elderly men and more common among men with higher WHR. Dietary patterns appeared to be associated with the presence of health conditions. In general, subjects with a chronic disease were more likely to have the vegetable-based diet and less likely to have the fruit- or meat-based diets. Future studies of diet and health in this population will need to carefully take into account these potential confounders.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Using a metabolomics approach, we systematically searched for circulating metabolite biomarkers for pancreatic cancer risk in a case-control study nested within two prospective Shanghai cohorts. Included in this study were 226 incident pancreatic cancer cases and their individually-matched controls. Untargeted mass spectrometry platforms were used to measure metabolites in blood samples collected prior to cancer diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was performed to assess the associations of metabolites with pancreatic cancer risk. We identified 10 metabolites associated with pancreatic cancer, after accounting for multiple comparisons (the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The majority of the identified metabolites were glycerophospholipids (ORs per SD increase: 0.44 to 2.32; p values: 7.2 × 10 to 1.0 × 10 ), six of which were associated with decreased risk and one with increased risk. Additionally, levels of coumarin (OR = 1.96, p = 3.7 × 10 ) and picolinic acid (OR = 2.53, p = 5.0 × 10 ) were positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk, while tetracosanoic acid was inversely associated with risk (OR: 0.48, p = 7.16 × 10 ). Four metabolites remained statistically significant after mutual adjustment. This study provides novel evidence that the dysregulation of glycerophospholipids may play an important role in pancreatic cancer development. This article is protected by copyright.

Recently, it was predicted that the Berry phase effect can also modify the exciton states in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, and lift the energy degeneracy of exciton states with opposite angular momentum through an effective valley-orbital coupling. Here, we report the first observation and control of the Berry-phase induced splitting of the 2p-exciton states in monolayer molybdenum diselenide using the intraexciton optical Stark spectroscopy. We observe the time-reversal-symmetric analog of the orbital Zeeman effect resulting from the valley-dependent Berry phase, which leads to energy difference of +14 (-14) meV between the $2p^+$ and $2p^-$ exciton states in +K (-K) valley, consistent with the ordering from our ab initio GW-BSE results. In addition, we show that the light-matter coupling between intraexciton states are remarkably strong, leading to prominent valley-dependent Autler-Townes doublet under resonant driving. Our study opens up new pathways to coherently manipulate the quantum states and excitonic excitation with infrared radiation in two-dimensional semiconductors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Floquet states, where a periodic optical field coherently drives electrons in solids(1-3), can enable novel quantum states of matter(4-6). A prominent approach to realize Floquet states is based on the optical Stark effect. Previous studies on the optical Stark effect often treated the excited state in solids as free quasi-particles(3,7-12). However, exciton-exciton interactions can be sizeably enhanced in low-dimensional systems and may lead to light-matter interactions that are qualitatively different from those in the non-interacting picture. Here we use monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) as a model system to demonstrate that the driving optical field can couple a hierarchy of excitonic states, and the many-body inter-valley biexciton state plays a dominant role in the optical Stark effect. Specifically, the exciton-biexciton coupling in monolayer MoSe2 breaks down the valley selection rules based on the non-interacting exciton picture. The photon-dressed excitonic states exhibit an energy redshift, splitting or blueshift as the driving photon frequency varies below the exciton transition. We determine a binding energy of 21 meV for the inter-valley biexciton and a transition dipole moment of 9.3 debye for the exciton-biexciton transition. Our study reveals the crucial role of many-body effects in coherent light-matter interaction in atomically thin two-dimensional materials.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"To determine the effects of extracellular matrix and neighboring cells on the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into progenitors of retinal cells and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). HESC were cultured on mouse PA6 stromal cells for approximately 2weeks to obtain neural progenitors. To induce photoreceptor marker expression, the neural progenitors were cultured on a confluent monolayer of ARPE19 or on laminin-coated dishes. To induce RPE markers, the neural progenitors were seeded onto human Bruch’s membrane or Matrigel. Cells were examined morphologically and stained with different RPE or neural progenitor markers. Microarray techniques were used to compare the gene expression profiles of hESC cultured on mouse fibroblasts or neural progenitors on PA6 cells to the transcriptome of the adult neural retina and RPE. HESC cultured on PA6 cells expressed neural progenitor markers β-tubulin III, PAX6, neural filament, GFAP and vimentin. Culturing these neural progenitors on confluent ARPE19 monolayer induced expression of the photoreceptor progenitor cell marker CRX; culturing neural progenitors on laminin substrates induced a neuronal phenotype with neurite formation. Neural progenitors expressed the RPE marker ZO-1 after culturing on Matrigel-coated dishes and the RPE marker Bestrophin after culturing on human Bruch's membrane explants. Hierarchical clustering analysis of samples suggested that when cultured on PA6 stromal cells hESC exhibited genetic characteristics towards differentiating into neural retina. Microarray analysis showed that after culturing on PA6 cells, stem cells expressed 117 new genes; among these there were 22 genes present in neural retina or RPE cells. The functions of these genes were highly related to cell proliferation, nervous system development and cell adhesion. HESC can be induced to differentiate into neural progenitors after culturing on PA6 cells. These neural progenitors can express RPE markers when cultured on Bruch's membrane or Matrigel, or photoreceptor markers when cultured on confluent ARPE19 or laminin. Additional studies are required to assess the function of hESC induced to express retinal or RPE markers prior to successful intraocular transplantation into animal models of retinal degeneration.\",\n",

Characteristics of these MMC-UPFC projects have not been fully researched in the existing literature, so it is difficult to effectively analyse the small-signal stability and low-frequency oscillation characteristics of power system containing these UPFCs. To solve this problem, the small-signal model of vector current-controlled MMC-UPFC is studied. Firstly, the equivalent model of the general structure UPFC is given in this study. Secondly, the dynamic model and small-signal model of UPFC are derived. Thirdly, the method of combining the UPFC model and the rest of the system is presented, so that the linearised model of the whole system can be established. At last, the small-signal model is verified in two test systems by time-domain simulations and modal analysis. Results show that the method proposed in this study is applicable for both the novel structure UPFC and the traditional structure UPFC, and that the small-signal model obtained can accurately reflect system characteristics.',\n",

By stabilizing previously unobserved compositions and phases of GaSeTe  at nanoscales on GaAs(111), we demonstrate abnormal band bowing effects and phase instability region when components crystallize in different phases. Advanced microscopy and spectroscopy measurements show as tellurium is alloyed into GaSe, nanostructures undergo hexagonal to monoclinic and isotropic to anisotropic transition. There exists an instability region (0.56\\u2009<\\u2009x\\u2009<\\u20090.67) where both phases compete and coexist, and two different bandgap values can be found at the same composition leading to anomalous band bowing effects.

Here, we demonstrate abrupt interface between two completely dissimilar material systems, i.e, GaTe-MoS2 p-n heterojunction transistors, where the resulting device possesses unique electronic properties and self-driven photoelectric characteristics. Fabricated heterostructure transistors exhibit forward biased rectifying behavior where the transport is ambipolar with both electron and hole carriers contributing to the overall transport. Under illumination, photoexcited electron-hole pairs are readily separated by large built-in potential formed at the GaTe-MoS2 interface efficiently generating self-driven photocurrent within <10 ms.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction: Epidemiological findings on the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and gastric cancer risk remain inconsistent, resulting in the designation of fruits and vegetables as “probable” and “possible” respectively, but not “convincing”, protective factors. However, intervention studies provide support for the effect of micronutrient supplementation in the prevention of gastric cancer and its precursor lesions, though the effects remain less substantial than for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. Objective: To ascertain the association between fruit and vegetable intake and non-cardia gastric cancer incidence with adjustment for H. pylori within East Asian cohort studies. Methods: The present analysis includes 1970 participants (810 prospectively ascertained non-cardia gastric cancer cases with 1160 matched controls) from 5 cohort studies in the Helicobacter pylori Biomarker Cohort Consortium. These cohorts collected blood samples as well as demographic, lifestyle, and dietary data at baseline. Pre-diagnostic antibody levels to 15 H. pylori proteins were assessed using multiplex serology. Conditional logistic regression, adjusting for total energy intake, smoking, and H. pylori status, was applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for gastric cancer risk across cohort- and sex-specific quartiles of fruit and vegetable intake. Results: Increasing fruit intake was significantly associated with decreasing risk of non-cardia gastric cancer, so that individuals in the highest quartile of fruit consumption had a 29% reduced odds of gastric cancer, compared to individuals in the lowest quartile (OR = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.52-0.95, P for trend = 0.02). Compared to CagA-positive H. pylori low fruit consumers, the strongest inverse association of gastric cancer risk was amongst those high fruit consumers without evidence of H. pylori antibodies (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.06-0.25), whereby the inverse association by increasing fruit consumption was attenuated among individuals infected with CagA-positive H. pylori (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-1.03). We observed a weaker, non-dose-response suggestion of an inverse association of vegetable intake with non-cardia gastric cancer risk. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study in the high-risk region of East Asia to examine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with non-cardia gastric cancer risk adjusted for H. pylori. We have found that high fruit intake may play a role in decreasing risk of non-cardia gastric cancer, even after adjustment for H. pylori subtype-specific infection.

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the clinical syndrome of all kinds of heart disease on the serious or final stage. About half of patients with organic heart disease will have heart failure that has a high incidence rate and mortality. The survival of heart failure was inferior to that of malignant tumor. OBJECTIVE: To confirm the clinical effect of Lujiao prescription on CHF and elucidate its possible mechanism. DESIGN: A control observation on CHF patients. SETTING: Department of Cardiovasology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 60 patients with CHF were selected from the department of cardiovasology in Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 1996 to December 1998. There were 31 male and 29 female. Included criteria: ①All of patients were consistent with Framinham diagnostic criteria. ② Above Ⅲ degree by New York Heart Association(NYHA). ③ Three months case history. ④Accept quantity sufficient diuretic and vasodilating agent (exclude angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ). ⑤ Left ventricle hypertrophy was proved by echocardiogram or chest X-ray. ⑥ Differentiation of symptoms and signs of Traditional Chinese Medicine refers to asthenia syndrome of differentiation of symptoms and signs of Traditional Chinese Medicine (1986, Researching Association of Chinese integrated medicine) General state of health and basic disease of the patients in the two groups were not significant deviation. METHODS: 60 patients of CHF were randomly divided into Lujiao prescription group(n=40) and Digoxin group (n=20) at the rate of 2:1. Lujiao prescription group: Orally liquid decoction of Lujiao Prescription 35 mL(1 mL contain crude drug 1.6 g) Bid. po. Course of treatment: 4 weeks. Digoxin group: Digoxin tablet, 0.125-0.25 mg, qd. po. course of treatment: 4 weeks. After 4-week treatment, the patients' clinical effect, integrals of the symptoms of renal deficiency, classification of function capacity of the NYHA, Lee's heart failure score, heart rate(HR), myocardium oxygen consumption(MOC), proportion of heart to chest, echocardiogram, measurement of plasma angitentionⅡ(AngⅡ) and plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were observed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ① The total clinic effective rate. ② Integrals of the symptoms of renal deficiency. ③ Classification of function capacity of the NYHA. ④ Lee's heart failure score. ⑤HR and MOC. ⑥ The proportion of heart to chest. ⑦ Ejection fraction(EF), cardic output (CO), interventricular septal thickness(IVST), posterior wall thickness(PWT) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) through echocardiogram. ⑧ The measurement of plasma AngⅡand plasma ANF. RESULTS:Totauy 60 patients entered the final analysis. ① The total clinical effective rate of the Lujiao prescription group was 90 %, which showed no significant difference from the Digoxin group (90 %, P > 0.05).② Improvement was significantly observed in the integrals of the symptom of renal deficiency of the patients in the Lujiao prescription group after treatment (P < 0.01), but which was not significant in the Digoxin group(P > 0.05). ③ It was found that classification of functional capacity of NYHA between Lujiao prescription group and Digoxin group after treatment was obviously decreased (P < 0.01). ④ Lee's heart failure score of patients in Lujiao prescription group and Digoxin group after treatment was decreased (P < 0.01). ⑤Myocardium oxygen consumption and HR of the patients in the Lujiao prescription group and Digoxin group after treatment was decreased (P < 0.01). ⑥ The proportion of heart to chest between Lujiao prescription group and Digoxin group after treatment was decreased (P < 0.01). ⑦ EF and CO were increased by Lujiao prescription and by Digoxin(P < 0.01,vs pretreatment, respectively). IVST, PWT, LVMI of Lujiao prescription group after treatment were obviously decreased (P < 0.01), while those of the Digoxin group were not obviously decreased (P > 0.05). ⑧ The level of plasma AngⅡof the patients in the Lujiao prescription group after treatment were obviously decreased (P < 0.01), while that of the Digoxin group were not obviously decreased (P > 0.05). The level of plasma ANF was decreased by Lujiao prescription and by digoxin(P < 0.01, vs pretreatment, respectively). CONCLUSION: There is increasing cardiac constriction power and regressing left ventricular hypertrophy of patients with CHF by Lujiao prescription. The therapeutical effect of Lujiao prescription for CHF is better than that of Digoxin. The effect may be related to the regulation of circular or local endocrine(plasma AngⅡ and ANF) disorder.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chemical vapor deposition and growth dynamics of highly anisotropic 2D lateral heterojunctions between pseudo-1D ReS2 and isotropic WS2 monolayers are reported for the first time. Constituent ReS2 and WS2 layers have vastly different atomic structure, crystallizing in anisotropic 1T and isotropic 2H phases, respectively. Through high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, this study is able to provide the very first atomic look at intimate interfaces between these dissimilar 2D materials. Surprisingly, the results reveal that ReS2 lateral heterojunctions to WS2 produce well-oriented (highly anisotropic) Re-chains perpendicular to WS2 edges. When vertically stacked, Re-chains orient themselves along the WS2 zigzag direction, and consequently, Re-chains exhibit six-fold rotation, resulting in loss of macroscopic scale anisotropy. The degree of anisotropy of ReS2 on WS2 largely depends on the domain size, and decreases for increasing domain size due to randomization of Re-chains and formation of ReS2 subdomains. Present work establishes the growth dynamics of atomic junctions between novel anisotropic/isotropic 2D materials, and overall results mark the very first demonstration of control over anisotropy direction, which is a significant leap forward for large-scale nanomanufacturing of anisotropic systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND. Sex steroid hormones play a central role in the development of endometrial cancer. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) modulates the bioavailability of circulating sex hormones and regulates their signaling systems in target cells. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that blood SHBG levels are associated inversely with the risk of endometrial cancer. A functional polymorphism, an amino acid substitution of asparagine (Asp) for aspartic acid (Asn) at residue 327 (Asp(327)Asn) (reference sequence 6259), in the SHBG gene recently was identified and has been associated with an increased half-life and elevated blood levels of SHBG. The authors tested the hypothesis that this genetic variance is associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer in the Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study, a population-based, case-control study that was conducted in urban Shanghai, China between 1997 and 2003. METHODS. This study included 1037 women with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer ages 30 years and 69 years and 1031 age-matched controls from the community who had completed an in-person interview and donated a blood and/or buccal cell sample to the study. Genotyping for the Asp(327)Asn polymorphism was performed by using the TaqMan method. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) derived from logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the genetic variation and endometrial cancer risk. RESULTS. The allele frequencies of Asn were 15.0% in cases and 17.1% in controls (P = .06). The variant Asn 327 allele was associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93) but not in premenopausal women (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.74-1.42). The inverse association was more pronounced among postmenopausal women who had a low body mass index (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.76) or longer years of menstruation (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.89), although the results from tests for multiplicative interaction were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS. The current results suggested that the codon 327 Asn allele in the SHBG gene may be related to a reduced risk of endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To eliminate the negative effects caused by three-phase unbalanced distribution, a novel soft-switching system based on single-phase inverter is proposed. The system achieves three-phase equilibrium distribution by adjusting the power supply of the electric equipments. This paper presents a track strategy named regulating frequency to promise no impulse current, which means regulating the output frequency of the inverter to make the output voltage of the inverter synchronize with the grid voltage. Firstly, make the output voltage of the inverter synchronize with the voltage of original access phase, then switch the electric equipment to the inverter. Secondly, make the output voltage of the inverter synchronize with the voltage of alternative access phase, then switch the electric equipment to the alternative access phase to accomplish the soft-switching. MATLAB software and experiment are used to carry out verification for this system. The result shows that the impulse current is practically zero when the electric equipments are switching. The system achieves soft-switching.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective:To observe availability and security of risedronate sodium capsules on prevention and treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Methods:This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical research. All patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, trail group and control group. During 12 months, patients of trail group took risedronate sodium capsules orally every morning, patients of control group took placebo orally every morning, at the same time with all patients taking calcichew D orally every night. The double-energy bone density measurement was used to measure lumbar and hip bone density was measured and lateral thoracolumbar vertebrae radiograph was took 3 times, before treatment, after 6 months and 12 months. Many security indicators were observed at the same time, such as electrocardiogram, blood and urine routine, liver and renal functions. Results:42 patients had been involved in the clinical research program. Compared with control group of the sample change data of lumbar bone density of trail group after 6 and 12 months continuous treatment has both statistical significance. The sample change data for hip bone density of trail group show that there are no statistical significance compared with that of control group. All the security indicators had no abnormal change and no bone fragility fracture incident was observed during this whole program period. Conclusion: From this program , risedronate sodium capsules could be effective and secure on treating postmenopausal osteoporosis. The lumbar bone density of patients could increase obviously during 6 months continuous treatment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Leisure time exercise has been linked to lower circulating levels of inflammatory markers. Few studies have examined the association of nonexercise physical activity with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included 1005 Chinese women aged 40-70 years. Usual physical activity was assessed through in-person interviews using a validated physical activity questionnaire. Plasma proinflammatory cytokines and urinary F-2-isoprostanes were measured. Multivariable linear models were used to evaluate the association of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers with nonexercise physical activity and its major components. Results: Nonexercise physical activity accounted for 93.8% of overall physical activity energy expenditure. Levels of nonexercise physical activity were inversely associated with circulating concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 (P-trend=0.004), IL-1 (P-trend=0.03) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) (P-trend=0.01). Multivariable-adjusted concentrations of these cytokines were 28.2% for IL-6, 22.1% for IL-1, and 15.9% for TNF- lower in the highest quartile of nonexercise physical activity compared with the lowest quartile. Similar inverse associations were found for two major components of nonexercise physical activity, walking and biking for transportation, and household activity. No significant associations were observed between nonexercise physical activity and oxidative stress markers. Conclusion: Daily nonexercise physical activity is associated with lower levels of systemic inflammation. This finding may have important public health implications because this type of activity is the main contributor to overall physical activity among middle-aged and elderly women.',\n",

QOL was evaluated at 6 and 36 months post-diagnosis using the General Quality of Life Inventory. Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate changes in QOL and their associations with socio-demographic and medical factors.In general, breast cancer patients showed significant improvement over time in the physical, psychological, and social well-being domains, as well as overall QOL. However, QOL scores in several facets did not improve or even deteriorated, including increased negative feelings, reduced social support and interpersonal relationships, and worsened financial situation and living environment. Age at diagnosis was inversely associated with QOL changes in physical and psychological well-being and overall QOL scores. Compared with those who were disease-free, patients with a recurrence of disease had significantly poorer QOL scores across all well-being domains and almost all facets. Patients who received radiotherapy experienced significant improvements in physical and social well-being and overall QOL. Mixed ER/PR status was associated with improved scores in physical and psychological well-being and overall QOL. Education, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity score, TNM stage, type of surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy were only associated with changes in certain well-being domains and/or facets, but not overall QOL. Tamoxifen use was not associated with changes in QOL outcomes.Our study provides valuable information for developing strategies/interventions for improving the QOL of breast cancer patients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: No prospective study has investigated the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the risk of primary liver cancer (PLC) in mainland China, and little is known about the effect of diabetes duration on PLC risk. Design: Data from two population-based cohorts (the Shanghai Men's Health Study, SMHS, 2002-2006 and the Shanghai Women's Health Study, SWHS, 1996-2000) were thus used to assess the associations among T2DM, diabetes duration and PLC risk in Chinese population. Results: During follow-up through 2009, 344 incident PLC cases were identified among 60 183 men and 73 105 women. T2DM is significantly associated with the increased risk of PLC in both men [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.51] and women (HR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.03-2.61). The highest risk of incident liver cancer was observed in the first 5 years after diabetes diagnosis, and decreased substantially with the prolonged diabetes duration (P-trend < 0.001). No synergistic interaction in the development of PLC was found between diabetes and other known risk factors. Conclusions: T2DM is associated with the increased risk of subsequent liver cancer within 5 years after diagnosis in Chinese population, suggesting that hyperinsulinaemia rather than hyperglycaemia is more likely to be a primary mediator for this association.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We report on the vibrational (Raman) spectrum and structural transformation of semiconducting pseudo-1D GaTe and ZrTe3 nanomaterials driven by ambient molecular interactions at the nanoscale by angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and environmental X-ray photoelectron (XPS) measurements. The results show that tellurium containing pseudo-1D materials undergo drastic structural and physical changes within a week. During this process, new Raman peaks start to emerge and surface roughness increases substantially. Surprisingly, aged Raman spectra of GaTe, ZrTe3, and alpha-TeOx show striking similarities suggesting that oxidation of tellurium takes place. Careful, environmental tests reveal that the interaction between GaTe and H2O molecules forms Te-O bonds at the outermost layers of GaTe which leads to newly emerging Raman peaks, a much reduced Schottky junction current density, and an anisotropic to isotropic structural transition. These findings offer fresh interpretation of the aging mechanisms for these material systems, provide new interpretation of the Raman spectrum of aged GaTe which was previously presumed to be of the hexagonal phase, and introduce an anisotropic to isotropic transformation effect induced by molecular interactions on the surface.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dietary red meat and animal fat have been linked to endometrial cancer (EC) risk, but the impact of bioavailable iron in animal-derived foods has been less well studied. Our objective was to investigate the effects of iron and fats on the risk of EC in a large, population-based, case-control study. The Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study enrolled 1,204 EC cases and 1,212 controls who completed in-person interviews, including a food frequency questionnaire. Animal-derived iron and fat intakes were calculated from dietary intakes and food composition tables. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate independent and joint effects of iron and fat on EC risk. Animal-derived iron intake was positively associated with EC risk [adjusted OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.4-2.7, P(trend) < 0.01, highest vs. lowest quartile], predominantly after menopause (OR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.4-3.4, P(trend) < 0.01) and in women with BMI >or= 25 kg/m(2)(OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.4-7.5 in postmenopausal obese women, P(trend) < 0.01). Animal-derived fat was also associated with postmenopausal EC risk (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.5, P(trend) < 0.01). Multiplicative interactions between animal-derived iron and BMI or animal-derived fat intake were not observed. Animal-derived iron intake is associated with increased risk of EC after menopause and among obese women. Avoidance of animal-derived (heme) iron may reduce the risk of EC in these women.',\n",

Results from epidemiologic studies on specific types of PUFAs for lung cancer risk, however, are inconclusive. We prospectively evaluated the association of specific types of dietary PUFA intakes and lung cancer risk in two population-based cohort studies, the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) and Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS) with a total of 121,970 study participants (i.e., 65,076 women and 56,894 men). Dietary fatty acid intakes were derived from data collected at the baseline using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Cox proportional hazards model was performed to assess the association between PUFAs and lung cancer risk.

       "  'abstract': 'Background. Animal studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory properties. Results from epidemiologic studies, however, have been inconclusive. We prospectively evaluated the association of dietary PUFA intakes and lung cancer risk in two population-based cohort studies, the Shanghai Men’s Health Study (SMHS) and Shanghai Women’s Health Study (SWHS).  Methods. A total of 130,823 study participants (i.e., 60,427 men and 70,396 women) were included in the current analysis. Dietary fatty acid intakes were derived from data collected at the baseline by validated food frequency questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards model was applied to assess the association between PUFAs intake and lung cancer risk with adjustment for age, smoking status, smoking packs-year (men only), drinking status, BMI, physical activity status, total energy, red meat intake, vegetable intake, vitamin supplemental use, menopausal status and hormone replacement therapy (women only).  Results. We found an inverse association between total PUFA intakes and lung cancer risk [hazard ratios (HRs) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for quintiles 2, 3, 4, and 5 versus quintile 1 were 0.73 (0.56-0.95), 0.78 (0.59-1.03), 0.64 (0.47-0.87) and 0.55 (0.37-0.82) in SMHS and 0.69 (0.53-0.90), 0.76 (0.58-0.99), 0.60 (0.44-0.81), and 0.53 (0.36-0.79) in SWHS)]. A similar pattern was observed for consumption of linoleic acid, total n-6 PUFAs and the ratio n-6 PUFAs/n-3 PUFAs in adenocarcinoma patients. This inverse association was more likely in male ever-smokers for total PUFAs, linoleic acid and total n-6 PUFAs. On the other hand, EPA intake was positively associated with lung cancer risk in female never-smokers [HRs and 95% CIs: 1.10 (0.85-1.42), 1.36 (1.05-1.77), 1.28 (0.97-1.88) and 1.30 (0.97-1.74), for quintiles 2-5 versus quintile 1]. A similar positive association between DHA intake and lung cancer risk in female never-smokers was also observed.  Conclusions. Total polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic and total n-6 PUFA intakes were associated with decreased risk of lung cancer. EPA and DHA intakes were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among female never-smokers.

This study investigated (1) the association between self-reported vitamin supplement use (multivitamin, A, B, C, and E) and breast cancer and (2) the combined effect of vitamin supplements in relation to dietary vitamin intakes on breast cancer risk.The Shanghai Breast Cancer Study was a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai in 1996-1998 (Phase I) and 2002-2004 (Phase II). Participants were aged 25-64 (Phase I) and 20-70 years (Phase II). The analyses included 3,454 incident breast cancer cases and 3,474 controls. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to determine adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for breast cancer risk associated with vitamin supplement use.Overall, breast cancer risk was not related to any vitamin supplement intake. However, a 20% reduction in breast cancer risk was observed with vitamin E supplement use among women with low-dietary vitamin E intake (OR = 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-1.0). A non-significant 20% risk reduction was observed among vitamin B supplement users with low B dietary intake (OR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-1.1). Frequent use of a vitamin B supplement was adversely associated with breast cancer risk among those with high dietary vitamin B intake (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.9-2.1; P for interaction = 0.07).This study suggests that vitamins E and B supplements may confer protection against breast cancer among women who have low dietary intake of those vitamins.',\n",

More recently, it became accessible in exciton-based solid-state systems at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate bosonic condensation driven by excitons hosted in an atomically thin layer of MoSe2, strongly coupled to light in a solid-state resonator. The structure is operated in the regime of collective strong coupling between a Tamm-plasmon resonance, GaAs quantum well excitons, and two-dimensional excitons confined in the monolayer crystal. Polariton condensation in a monolayer crystal manifests by a superlinear increase of emission intensity from the hybrid polariton mode, its density-dependent blueshift, and a dramatic collapse of the emission linewidth, a hallmark of temporal coherence. Importantly, we observe a significant spin-polarization in the injected polariton condensate, a fingerprint for spin-valley locking in monolayer excitons. Our results pave the way towards highly nonlinear, coherent valleytronic devices and light sources.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The observed associations of fruit and vegetable consumption with the risk of colorectal cancer have been inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with the risk of colorectal cancer among Chinese men.61,274 male participants aged 40-74 years were included. A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered to collect information on usual dietary intake, including 8 fruits and 38 vegetables commonly consumed by residents of Shanghai. Follow-up for diagnoses of colon or rectal cancer was available through 31 December 2010. Dietary intakes were analyzed both as categorical and continuous variables. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancers using Cox proportional hazards models.After 390,688 person-years of follow-up, 398 cases of colorectal cancer (236 colon and 162 rectal) were observed in the cohort. Fruit consumption was inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (fifth vs. first quintile HR 0.67; 95 % CI 0.48, 0.95; p trend = 0.03), whereas vegetable intake was not significantly associated with risk. The associations for subgroups of fruits and legumes, but not other vegetable categories, were generally inversely associated with the risk of colon and rectal cancers.Fruit intake was generally inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer, whereas vegetable consumption was largely unrelated to risk among middle-aged and older Chinese men.',\n",

Acupuncture was applied to Yishu (EX), Feishu (BL13), Pishu (BL 20), etc. according to syndrome identification. The treatment was given once every other day for 12 weeks. For patients in the medication group, Glibenclamide (2.5-7.5 mg/time, 1-2 times/d according to blood sugar level) was given for 12 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and fasting leptin (FLP) were detected by using glucose oxidase method, radioimmunoassay and ELISA, respectively. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated.In comparison with pre-treatment, FBG levels and HOMA-IR in both acupuncture and medication groups, and FINS and FLP levels in the acupuncture group were decreased significantly (P < 0.01), while ISI in both acupuncture and medication groups, and FINS level in the medication group were increased remarkably after the treatment (P < 0.01). Comparison between two groups showed that after the treatment, FINS and FLP levels, and HOMA-IR of the acupuncture group were considerably lower than those of the medication group (P < 0.01), while ISI of the acupuncture group was significantly higher than that of the medication group (P < 0.01).Acupuncture therapy is effective in lowering FLP level, which may contribute to its clinical effect in improving type-II DM.',\n",

Image edges are extracted by using multi-scale edge detection based on wavelet transform to improve stability. Straight lines are used to fit these edges and every line is assigned a reliability value according to the geometric and gray characteristics. A pair of lines was taken for the basic matching unit. The similar degree between units from different images is computed by Mahalanobis distance method. The registration process is performed by a weighted voting algorithm, each voting holds different weights according to the similar degree between units and the reliability of elemental lines. The experimental result shows that this method is fast, stable and effective in dealing with similar transform (rotation, scale and translation) without any prior knowledge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Objective Circulating estrogen levels have been related to the risk of several female cancers. Blood levels of estrogen are controlled by estrogen synthesis enzymes. Genetic variation of estrogen genes thus may influence circulating estrogen levels. We investigated the associations of genetic polymorphisms in CYP19A1, a critical gene involved in estrogen synthesis, with plasma levels of sex hormones among postmenopausal Chinese women. Methods Included in this study were 345 postmenopausal community controls from a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai. Fasting blood samples from those women were measured for blood estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, and testosterone. A total of 19 genetic polymorphisms in CYP19A1 were genotyped using AB17900 or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Differences in plasma levels of hormones by genotype were examined using variance analysis. Result The geometric means of plasma levels of estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, and testosterone were 10.1, 16.8, 969.0, and 202.9 pg/ml, respectively, for this study population. We found that plasma levels of estrone were associated with rs28566535 (P=0.0180), rs730154 (P=0.0141), and rs936306 (P=0.0274) in block 2. In the same block, the haplotype CGCTA was related to level of estrone (P=0.0064). Single nucleotide polymorphism rs1902584 in block 1 was associated with estradiol only in overweight postmenopausal women. No clear association with sex hormones was noted for the other genetic polymorphisms evaluated in the study. Conclusion Single nucleotide polymorphisms in blocks 1 and 2 of the CYP19A1 gene are related to plasma levels of estrogen among postmenopausal Chinese women and may therefore play an important role in the etiology of hormone-related cancers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Studies have shown that the inflammatory activation of miroglia (MG) and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) play a dominant role in inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that sinomenine, an anti-inflammatory agent extracted from Sinomenium acutum, can directly protect neurons against cerebral ischemia injury. However, there are no reports on its effect on ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory activation of MG. In the present study, an in vitro ischemia/reperfusion model was developed with mouse BV-2 microglia cells, a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R), and the inhibitory effect of sinomenine pretreatment on inflammatory activation was confirmed through measurement of inflammatory indicators. Mechanistically, sinomenine suppressed OGD/R-induced inflammatory activation through the SP1/miRNA-183-5p/IκB-α pathway. In conclusion, this study shows that sinomenine effectively inhibits OGD/R-induced inflammatory activation in MG by suppressing the activation of transcription specificity protein 1 (SP 1). This finding is of significance for the clinical use of sinomenine in treating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Forced oscillations (FOs), or low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) caused by periodic, continuous, small power disturbances, threaten the security and stability of power systems. Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices can effectively mitigate LFOs via stability control. We propose a novel method that mitigates FOs by shifting the resonant frequency. Based on the features of the linearized swing equation of a generator, a resonant frequency shift can be achieved by controlling the synchronous torque coefficient using a unified power flow controller (UPFC). Because of the resonance mechanism, the steady-state response of an FO can be effectively mitigated when the resonant frequency changes from the original one, which was close to the disturbance frequency. The principle is that a change in resonant frequency affects the resonance condition. Simulations are conducted in a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system, and the simulation results verify that the method is straightforward to implement and can significantly mitigate FOs. The controller robustness when the resonant frequency is not accurately estimated is also analyzed in the simulations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Little is known about the association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) and blood pressure (BP) parameters, including systolic and diastolic BP, pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and hypertension in non-Western populations that have not yet been exposed to foods fortified with vitamins and seldom use vitamin D supplements. A cross-sectional analysis of plasma 25(OH) D levels in association with BP measures was performed for 1460 participants (1055 women and 405 men, aged 40-74 years) of two large cohort studies in Shanghai. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were conducted. Overall, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 55.8% using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, USA criteria and 29.9% using WHO criteria. The median plasma 25(OH)D level in the population was 38.0 nmol/l for men and 33.6 nmol/l for women (P<0.01) among participants who were not on antihypertensive drugs. Among men, BP parameters (systolic BP, diastolic BP and MAP) were significantly and inversely associated with higher quintiles of 25(OH)D compared with the lowest quintile (P-trend < 0.05 for all). Vitamin D non-deficient status (WHO criteria) was inversely associated with hypertension (ORadjusted = 0.29; 95% CI 0.10, 0.82). An inverse association was also found between hypertension and the highest quintile of 25(OH)D (ORadjusted = 0.16; 95% CI 0.04, 0.65 for >= 50.6 nmol/l; Ptrend 0.02). Among women, no significant associations were found for BP parameters and hypertension. The present study shows that vitamin D deficiency is common among adults in urban China. Circulating 25(OH)D levels were inversely related to the levels of individual BP parameters and hypertension among middle-aged and elderly men but not among women.

       "  'abstract': 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a key regulator of the transcriptional expression for the cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) genes. CYP1A2 is one of the major CYP1 enzymes that catalyse 2-hydroxylation of estrogen, a hormone that plays a critical role in the etiology of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated whether two common polymorphisms in these two genes, CYP1A2* 1F and AhR Lys554Arg, were associated with breast cancer risk in 1090 cases and 1183 controls, a subset of the population-based case-control study, the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. Caffeine tests were performed in vivo in a subset of 236 study subjects to investigate the relationship of these two polymorphisms with CYP1 A2 activity. For the AhR gene, the A (Lys) allele was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Using the genotype GG as reference, odds ratios of 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-0.99] for the AG genotype and 0.76 (95% CI = 0.58-1.01) for the AA genotype (P for trend = 0.018) were obtained. However, no association was observed between CYP1A2 genotypes and breast cancer risk, although the CYP1A2* 1F polymorphism was found to be related to CYP1A2 activity. The geometric mean values for the caffeine metabolites ratio were 2.90, 2.30, and 1.95 for CC, AC, and AA genotypes, respectively (P for trend = 0.024). In conclusion, the results from our study suggest that the AhR Lys554Arg polymorphism may be a genetic susceptibility factor for breast cancer, whereas CYP1A2* 1F, which is a potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphism, may not be related to breast cancer risk.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Objective To investigate the change of lipid levels in high-fat diets induced atherosclerotic rats treated with pioglitazone, and to explore its clinical significance. Methods Twenty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into control group (n=9) and high-fat diets group (n=17). High-fat diets group received high-fat diets for 12 weeks, and then were randomly devided into model group (n=8) and pioglitazone-treated group (n=9). The control group, model group and pioglitazone-treated group received intragastric administration with distilled water, distilled water (1.5 ml/100 g) and pioglitazone 10 mg/(kg·d) respectively. Meanwhile, all animals continued to receive high-fat diets. After 4 weeks, the serum lipid level of all rats was measured, and the aortic pathological changes were observed. Results Compared with control group, the serum levels of TG, TC in model group and pioglitazone-treated group were significantly higher after 12 weeks' high-fat diets(P<0.01).After intervention with pioglitazone for 4 weeks, the serum levels of TG, TC and LDL-C were decreased (P<0.01). Moreover, the serum levels of TG, TC in pioglitazone-treated group was markedly lower than those in model group(P<0.01). Aortic thickening and smooth muscle cell proliferation were induced in high-fat diets group. Conclusions Pioglitazone can improve lipid levels in hyperlipidemia rats, delay the pathological changes in aortic atherosclerosis, suggesting that the effect of pioglitazone on anti-atherosclerosis may be partly attributed to the improvement of blood lipid.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) polymorphism rs671 (Glu504Lys) causes ALDH2 inactivation and adverse acetaldehyde exposure among Asians, but little is known of the association between alcohol consumption and rs671 and ovarian cancer (OvCa) in Asians. We conducted a pooled analysis of Asian ancestry participants in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We included seven case-control studies and one cohort study comprising 460 invasive OvCa cases, 37 borderline mucinous OvCa and 1274 controls of Asian descent with information on recent alcohol consumption. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for OvCa risk associated with alcohol consumption, rs671 and their interaction were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. No significant association was observed for daily alcohol intake with invasive OvCa (OR comparing any consumption to none=0.83; 95% CI=0.58-1.18) or with individual histotypes. A significant decreased risk was seen for carriers of one or both Lys alleles of rs671 for invasive mucinous OvCa (OR=0.44; 95% CI=0.20-0.97) and for invasive and borderline mucinous tumors combined (OR=0.48; 95% CI=0.26-0.89). No significant interaction was observed between alcohol consumption and rs671 genotypes. In conclusion, self-reported alcohol consumption at the quantities estimated was not associated with OvCa risk among Asians. Because the rs671 Lys allele causes ALDH2 inactivation leading to increased acetaldehyde exposure, the observed inverse genetic association with mucinous ovarian cancer is inferred to mean that alcohol intake may be a risk factor for this histotype. This association will require replication in a larger sample.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is one of the major CYP450 enzymes catalyzing 4-hydroxylation, an important elimination step for estrogens. Relatively little is known, however, about the impact of this gene on the onset and cessation of menstruation, which are the significant milestones in a woman's life and predictors of many hormone related diseases. In this report, we described the association of four SNPs in the CYP1B1 gene, Arg48Gly, Ala119Ser, Leu432Val, and Asp449Asp, with the ages of menarche and menopause, years of menstruation and total number of menstrual cycles. Included in the study were 1958 community controls from two recently completed population-based case-control studies of breast cancer and endometrial cancer. No association was observed between the CYP1B1 polymorphisms and the age of menarche among either pre- or post-menopausal women. Among the women who experienced natural menopause, the three non-synonymous SNPs were significantly associated with menopausal age, years of menstruation, and total number of menstrual cycles. The Gly and Ser alleles of Arg48Gly and Ala119Ser were associated with later menopause, more years of menstruation and more menstrual cycles, while women with allele Val at Leu432Val had a 0.9 year earlier menopause, 1.0 year shorter reproductive span, and 12.6 fewer menstrual cycles than those women without this allele. In conclusion, the results from this study suggested that CYP1B1 genetic polymorphisms may be associated with the natural onset of menopause.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The synthesis and preliminary examination of CBI-CDPBO1 (2) and CBI-CDPBI1(3), CBI analogs of CC-1065 (1) and the duocarmycins incorporating the 3-carbamoyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzoxazole-7- carboxylate (CDPBO) and 3-carbamoyl-1,2-dihydro-3 H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzimidazole-7-carboxyl (CDPBI) DNA binding subunits, are detailed. The agents contain deep-seated modifications in the DNA binding subunits of the natural products with incorporation of a nitrogen capable of functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor (CDPBO, CDPBI) or hydrogen bond donor (CDPBI) on their inside concave face which is in intimate contact with the minor groove floor. The CDPBO subunit was prepared through use of a novel and effective MnO2- mediated oxidative coupling of 2-(benzyloxy)ethylamine with 5-hydroxyindole (4) to directly provide 2[(benzyloxy)methyl]pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzoxazole (6, 48%) in a reaction cascade that initially proceeds with amine regioselective C4 nucleophilic addition to the in situ generated p-quinone monoimine 13. Subsequent conversion of 6 to 8 (debenzylation; MnO2-NaCN, CH3OH) and selective reduction of the fused pyrrole (Et(3)SiH-CF3CO2H) completed the synthesis of the 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzoxazole-7-carboxylate ring system. The CDPBI subunit was prepared through selective C4 nitration of 22 followed by reduction of the nitro group and acid-catalyzed closure to the corresponding 2-[(benzyloxy)methyl]pyrrolo[3,2e]benzimidazole 25. The final conversion of 25 to the 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzimidazole-7-carboxylate ring system (CDPBI) followed the same protocols introduced for CDPBO. The DNA alkylation efficiencies of 2 and 3 were identical and both were substantially diminished relative to that of CBI-CDPI1 (40). Thus, the introduction of a single nitrogen atom in the DNA binding subunit of 40 has a pronounced and detrimental effect on the relative efficiency (100 x) of DNA alkylation. Consistent with these observations, the in vitro cytotoxic activity of (+)-2 and (+)-3 were comparable (IC50 200 pM, L1210) and 40 x less potent than (+)-40 (IC50 = 5 pM, L1210). In contrast to the large impact these small structural changes had on the effrciency of DNA alkylation, the selectivity of DNA alkylation by 2 and 3 was unperturbed and both agents were found to allcylate the same major sites as CBI-CDPI1 (40). The potential origin of these effects is discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Low birth weight (LBW) has been associated with subsequent risks of obesity and certain chronic diseases, but evidence for the associations is limited for the Chinese population. Methods: In this study we analyzed data from two population-based prospective cohort studies, the Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Shanghai Men's Health Study, to examine the associations between LBW and the risk of obesity and chronic diseases. Birth weight was self-reported at baseline; anthropometric measurements were made at study enrollment. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnoses were self-reported, whereas hypertension diagnoses were based on self-report and blood pressure measurements at baseline and follow-up surveys. Results: Birth weight was available for 11 515 men and 13 569 women. Non-linear associations were observed for birth weight with baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist: hip ratio (WHR), and waist: height ratio (WHtR; P < 0.05 for non-linearity), and LBW was linked with lower BMI, smaller WC, and larger WHR and WHtR. An excess risk of T2DM was observed for LBW (<2500 g) versus birth weight 2500-3499 g since baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.49) and since birth (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.54), whereas the HRs for hypertension since baseline and birth were 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.27) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.11-1.30), respectively. The risk of the diseases decreased as birth weight increased up to similar to 4000 g; further increases in birth weight did not convey additional benefits. Conclusion: The results suggest that LBW, an index of poor intrauterine nutrition, may affect health risks later in life in the Chinese population.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is a small secreted proteolytic enzyme with broad substrate specificity. Its expression has been shown to be associated with tumor invasion, metastasis and survival for a variety of cancers. We systematically evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMP-7 in relation to breast cancer survival in a large follow-up study. Included were 1,079 breast cancer cases that were recruited from 1996 to 1998 and followed for a median of 7.1 years as part of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study (SBCS). Eleven SNPs, including 2 known functional promoter SNPs, were analyzed using the Affymetrix Targeted Genotyping System. Associations with survival were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier functions. Statistically significant associations with disease-free and/or overall survival (OS) were found for 5 polymorphisms; these associations were explained primarily by 2 SNPs (rs11568818 and rs11225297) that were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the others. Patients homozygous for the rs11568818 rare allele (G) had a significantly worse prognosis (OS HR: 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.6) than patients homozygous for the common allele (A). Significantly improved survival was seen for patients with the rs11225297 T allele, and this association occurred in a dose-response manner; patients with AT (OS HR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9) and TT (OS HR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.8) fared better than patients with AA (p-value for trend: 0.001). Thus, common MMP-7 genetic polymorphisms were found to be significant determinants of survival among Chinese women with breast cancer.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Alloying selected layered transitional metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) with unique chain-like structures offers the opportunities for structural, optical, and electrical engineering thus expands the regime of this class of pseudo-one-dimensional materials. Here, the novel phase transition in anisotropic Nb(1-x)TixS3 alloys is demonstrated for the first time. Results show that Nb(1-x)TixS3 can be fully alloyed across the entire composition range from triclinic-phase NbS3 to monoclinic-phase TiS3. Surprisingly, incorporation of a small concentration of Ti (x approximate to 0.05-0.18) into NbS3 host matrix is sufficient to induce triclinic to monoclinic transition. Theoretical studies suggest that Ti atoms effectively introduce hole doping, thus rapidly decreases the total energy of monoclinic phase and induces the phase transition. When alloyed, crystalline and optical anisotropy are largely preserved as evidenced by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy. Further Raman measurements identify Raman modes to determine crystalline anisotropy direction and offer insights into the degree of anisotropy. Overall results introduce Nb(1-x)TixS3 as a new and easy phase change material and mark the first phase engineering in anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) trichalcogenide systems for their potential applications in two-dimensional superconductivity, electronics, photonics, and information technologies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays,ischemic stroke gradually become a major cause of morbidity and mortality.Furthermore,the hotspot and difficulty on neuroscience research is looking for new and effective intervention strategy.In general,vascular protection belongs to neuroprotection in spite of slight distinction in entity.In practical terms,any strategy proven to reduce the incidence of fatal and nonfatal vascular events could be said to be \"vascular protection\",including antithrombotic and antihypertensive therapies,and agents with direct beneficial effects on vascular endothelium.Moreover,considering that vascular events include myocardial infarction,stroke and claudication,so most prominent agents in this realm include the statins,angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEI),and angiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs).In traditional Chinese medicine,some therapies,such as activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis,invigorating the kidney and replenishing the essence,dispelling wind and removing obstruction in the meridians as well as warming yang to promote diuresis,are possibly related to vascular protection,nevertheless,positive effect should be waiting for more evidence in the near future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To investigate the association between meat intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes (type 2 DM) in a large cohort of middle-aged women.Incident cases of type 2 DM were identified during an average of 4.6 years of follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 74,493 middle-aged, Chinese women (mean age +/- SD =51.7+/- 8.97 years). Participants completed in-person interviews that collected information on type 2 DM risk factors such as dietary factors and physical activity in adulthood. Anthropometric indices were measured. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). We included in the current analysis 70,609 women who had no prior history of type 2 DM at study recruitment and who had valid dietary data. The association of type 2 DM with unprocessed meat intake (g/day) and the frequency of consumption of processed meat was evaluated using the Cox model with adjustment for age, kcals/day, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), vegetable intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, income level, education level, occupation status, and history of hypertension and chronic disease at baseline.We identified 1972 incident cases of type 2 DM during a total of 326,581 person-years of follow up. Intake of unprocessed meat, particularly poultry, was associated with a decrease in the risk of type 2 DM in this cohort. The fully adjusted relative risks (RRs) for quintiles of total unprocessed meat intake were 1.00, 0.78, 0.83, 0.74, and 0.83 (P for trend: <0.01). When the joint effect between meat intake and BMI categories was evaluated, high intake of total unprocessed meat appeared to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 DM among obese women but a reduced risk among lean women (P value for the interaction tests = 0.05). Processed meat consumption was positively associated with the risk of type 2 DM. The adjusted RR was 1.15 (95% 1.01-1.32) in women consuming processed meats compared to those who did not consume processed meats (P=0.04).Processed meat intake was positively associated with the risk of type 2 DM. There was an indication that the effect of unprocessed meat intake on type 2 DM may be modified by BMI.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Owing to their strong photon emission, low excitonic binding energies, and nearly-ideal band offset values for water splitting reactions, direct gap quasi-2D gallium chalcogenides are potential candidates for applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, and photonics. Unlike other 2D materials systems, chemical functionalization of gallium chalcogenides is still at its seminal stages. Here, we propose vapor phase pyridine intercalation technique to manipulate optical properties of gallium chalcogenides. After functionalization, the excitonic dynamics of quasi-2D GaSe change significantly as evidenced by an increase in integrated PL intensity and emergence of a new emission feature that is below the band edge. Based on our DFT calculations, we attribute these to formation of bound exciton complexes at the trap sites introduced by chemical reaction between pyridine and GaSe. On the contrary, pyridine functionalization does not impact the optical properties of GaTe, instead treats GaTe surface to prevent oxidization of tellurium atoms. Overall, results suggest novel ways to control properties of gallium chalcogenides on demand and unleash their full potential for a range of applications in photonics and optoelectronics. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Few studies have investigated the association of di- etary carbohydrate and fiber intake with breast cancer risk in women in China, where carbohydrate intake is traditionally high. Objective: The objective was to prospectively evaluate the associ- ation of dietary carbohydrates, glycemic index, glycemic load, and dietary fiber with breast cancer risk and to determine whether the effect of these dietary intakes is modified by age and selected insulin- or estrogen-related risk factors. Design: A total of 74,942 women aged 40-70 y were recruited into the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a population-based cohort study. Dietary intake was assessed by in-person interviews. A Cox pro- portional hazards regression model was used to evaluate associa- tions. Results: During an average of 7.35 y of follow-up, 616 incident breast cancer cases were documented. A higher carbohydrate intake was associated with a higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer (P for trend ¼ 0.002). Compared with the lowest quintile, the hazard ratios (and 95% CIs) were 1.47 (1.00, 2.32) and 2.01 (1.26, 3.19) for the fourth and fifth quintiles, respectively. A similar pattern was found for glycemic load. The association between carbohydrate intake and breast cancer was significantly modified by age; the increased breast cancer risk associated with carbohydrate intake was restricted to women who were younger than 50 y. No significant association of breast cancer risk with glycemic index or dietary fiber intake was found. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a high carbohydrate intake and a diet with a high glycemic load may be associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women or women ,50 y.

       "  'abstract': \"Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is a major selenoenzyme in plasma and linked to antioxidant properties and possibly to lung cancer; however, supporting evidence is limited. We investigated the association between pre-diagnostic plasma SELENOP concentration and lung cancer risk in a case-control study of 403 cases and 403 individually matched controls nested within the Shanghai Men's Health Study. SELENOP concentration in pre-diagnostic plasma samples was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cases were diagnosed with lung cancer between 2003 and 2010. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for studying the association between plasma SELENOP concentration and lung cancer risk. Cases had slightly lower plasma SELENOP concentration than controls (4.3 +/- 1.2 versus 4.4 +/- 1.1 mg/l, P difference = 0.09). However, the multivariate analysis showed no association between plasma SELENOP concentration and lung cancer risk among all participants (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.54-2.14 for quartile 4 versus quartile 1), or by smoking status or tumor aggressiveness. In contrast, although the number of cases was limited, plasma SELENOP concentration was positively associated with lung adenocarcinoma risk (OR = 5.38, 95% CI = 1.89-15.35 for tertile 3 versus tertile 1), but not with squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.43-6.70). Our study of adult men living in selenium non-deficient areas in China provides little support for the inverse association between pre-diagnostic plasma SELENOP concentration and lung cancer risk. Our finding of a positive association with risk of lung adenocarcinoma needs to be interpreted with caution.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Random errors, from any source, will attenuate epidemiological risk estimates. Before we launched the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS), a large population-based cohort study investigating the diet-cancer association among Chinese men, a dietary calibration study was conducted among 96 men aged 40-75 years (mean age 56.5 years), with biweekly 24-hour dietary recalls (24HDRs) implemented over a 1-year period. Data from this study were analysed to evaluate the nature and magnitude of variances for intake of 26 nutrients among SMHS participants, to compare variance ratios of 26 nutrients among Chinese men and women and individuals in other studies, and to estimate the number of 24HDRs required for future dietary calibration studies in similar populations.Ninety-six healthy, free-living men in Shanghai were administered biweekly 24HDR interviews 24 times over a 1-year period. To assess between-individual and within-individual contributions to variance, a mixed effects model was fitted and ratios of within-individual to between-individual (sigma(w)(2)/sigma(b)(2)) dietary intake variances were computed.Shanghai, China.In agreement with reports from studies conducted in the USA and many other countries, we found that within-individual variances were usually larger than between-individual variances in dietary intake for all nutrients. The sum of all other variation (e.g. weekday and weekend, seasonal, interviewer) accounted for less than 5% of total variation. Ratios of within- to between-individual variances (for log-transformed data) ranged from 1.25 for carbohydrate intake to near 8 for delta-tocopherol intake.The results of this study suggest that among middle-aged and elderly Chinese men in Shanghai, within- and between-individual variation account for more than 95% of the total variation for 26 nutrients. Further dietary validation studies in the same population could be adequately carried out with only 12 days of dietary recalls, if 100 participants were enrolled.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that transplantation of controlled release glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells can effectively promote the motor function and sensory function recovery of rhesus monkeys with spinal cord injury.OBJECTIVE: To validate whether co-transplantation of controlled release glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells exhibits better protective effects on spinal cord glial scar of rhesus monkeys with spinal cord injury than cell transplantation alone.METHODS: Twelve rhesus monkeys were collected to prepare animal models of acute severe spinal cord injury using modified Allen's method, and then randomly divided into three groups: experimental group, co-transplantation of controlled release glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells; control group, simple transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells;blank control group, PBS. After 5 months, paraffin specimens of the spinal cord were made for detection of morphological and compositional characteristics of glial scar, regeneration of nerve fibers in the scar, glial scar area, and average absorbance of glial fibrillary acidic protein.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Glial scar in the injured spinal cord was composed of astrocytes and histocytes. Less spinal cord glial scar area and lower absorbance value could be observed in the experimental and control groups as compared with the blank control group(P < 0.05). In addition, in the blank control group, neurofilament negative fibers could be observed in the glial scar, and astrocytes proliferated obviously. The experimental and control groups showed less fibers passed through the scar area. The glial scar area and average absorbance in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group(P < 0.05). These findings suggest that compared with simple transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells, co-transplantation of controlled release glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived neuron-like cells shows better protective effects spinal tissue structure after spinal cord injury, which may be one of mechanisms by which the number of glial scars is reduced to a greater extent.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, which is characterized by inflammatory synovitis, and the subsequent destruction of articular cartilage and bone. Sinomenine is a traditional Chinese medicine, which has been employed as a clinical treatment for RA for several years in China. The present study investigated the anti-arthritic effects of sinomenine on Sprague-Dawley rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The differentially expressed proteins in serum were measured by proteomic analysis in order to generate a differentially expressed protein network. A total of 320 differentially expressed proteins were detected in the drug-treated group compared with in the control group. In the sinomenine-treated group, 79 differentially expressed proteins were detected compared with in the model group, and among these, 46 proteins were upregulated. Gene ontology analysis revealed that five functions were affected by sinomenine treatment of CIA rats compared with in the model group. In addition, Ingenuity (R) Pathway Analysis was used to measure enriched signaling pathways, which revealed nuclear factor-KB, histones, heat shock proteins and protein kinase B as core proteins, generating similar to 60 pair associations in the network. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to perform proteomic analysis in sinomenine-treated CIA rats, and the results revealed that numerous targets were involved in the process. In addition, the present study provided a novel approach and evidence for exploring the biological effects of sinomenine. Therefore, the findings of the present study may provide a novel insight into the anti-RA mechanisms of sinomenine, and may justify further exploration into its function in other relevant diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Abnormal sleep duration, either long or short, is associated with disease risk and mortality. Little information is available on sleep duration and its correlates among Chinese women.Using information collected from 68,832 women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), we evaluated sleep duration and its correlations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, health status, and anthropometric measurements and their indexes using polynomial logistic regression.The mean age of the study population was 59.6 years (SD=9.0; range: 44.6-79.9 years) at time of sleep duration assessment. Approximately 80% of women reported sleeping 6-8 h/day, 11.5% slept 5h or less, and 8.7% slept 9h or more. As expected, age was the strongest predictor for sleep duration and was negatively correlated with sleep duration. In general, sleep duration was positively associated with energy intake, intakes of total meat and fruits, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC) after adjustment for age and other factors. Both short and long sleep duration were negatively associated with education level, family income, and leisure-time physical activity and positively associated with number of live births, history of night shift work, and certain chronic diseases, compared to sleep duration around 7 h/day (6.5-7.4h/day). Short sleep duration was related to tea consumption and passive smoking. Long sleep duration was related to menopausal status and marital status.In this large, population-based study, we found that sleep duration among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women was associated with several sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and with disease status. The main limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design that does not allow us to draw any causal inference. However, this study provides information for future investigation into the nature of these associations so that recommendations can be developed to reduce sleep problems in middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. It also provides important information on potential confounders for investigation of sleep duration on health outcomes in this population.\",\n",

Targeting to solve the potential threatens in developing Jiangsu grid, feasibility for application of FACTS to improve system reliability and transfer capacity is investigated. Middle across-Yangtze-river transmission channel, southern-Suzhou system and western-Nanjing inter-city circle grid are set as the examples. The conclusions can be obtained that: with the application of FACTS, power flows in the system can be effectively controlled. The transfer capacity can be obviously improved, and induced voltage unstable problem during the severe faults such as bipolar latched in the ultra-high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) system can be prevented. Application of FACTS can also avoid the huge investment and difficult construction for the new across-river transmission channels and across-city cables. In summary, application of FACTS can prominently improve the efficiency and reliability of the system operation, and better economic and social benefits for the grid can be achieved.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'ALDH1 is a crucial element in the retinoic acid signaling pathway regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of normal stem cells, and may play an important role in cancer progression. However, research on ALDH1 gene expressionand breast cancer prognosis has yielded conflicting results. We evaluated the association between tumor tissue ALDH1A1/ALDH1A3 mRNA expression and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) prognosis in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS, N=463), Nashville Breast Health Study (NBHS, N=86), and Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS, N=47). Gene expression was measured in RNA isolated from breast cancer tissues. In the SBCSS, higher ALDH1A1 mRNA level was associated with improved disease-free (HR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95, per log unit change) and overall survival (HR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.93 per log unit change) independent of age at diagnosis, TNM stage and treatment. We replicated the findings for overall survival in the NBHS and SCCS (HR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.10-0.73) and for disease-free survival by a meta-analysis of four publicly-available gene expression datasets (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.97). No significant association was found for ALDH1A3.Our study suggests high expression of ALDH1A1 mRNA in tumor tissues may be an independent predictor of a favorable TNBC outcome.',\n",

Lower level or impaired function of endostatin is associated with a higher risk of developing malignant solid tumors and with a worse prognosis of the disease. The endostatin N104 polymorphism might be associated with an impaired ability to inhibit angiogenesis. We analyzed the tissues from 98 Caucasian prostate cancer patients for the presence of D104N polymorphism. The frequencies of homozygous 4349G/G(104D/D), and heterozygous 4349G/A(104D/N) were 83.67%(82/98) and 16.33%(16/98), respectively; no individuals were homozygous 4349A/A(104N/N). With the Fisher's exact test we found the genotype of D104N was not significantly related to age, tumor grade, PSA and clinical stage (P > 0.05). There was no difference in relapse free survival(RFS) or overall survival(OS) between patients with 104D/N and those with 104D/D (P = 0.8283, 0.3713 respectively). We concluded that endostatin polymorphism was not associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer in Caucasian patients. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.\",\n",

Plasma MDA-LDL and its immune complexes (LDL-IC) levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood lipid levels and inflammatory markers were also studied. All data was subjected to statistical analysis. Results Compared with the control, plasma lipids and apolipoproteins levels in patients with RA remained unchanged, except that apolipoprotein B levels increased in RA patients (P<0.05); meanwhile no difference was found in plasma lipids and apolipoproteins concentrations between simple RA patients and RA patients with CAD. MDA-LDL level in RA with CAD, simple RA and control were 187.81±90.89 mg/L, 102.01±57.73 mg/L and 32.65±27.00 mg/L, respectively. LDL-IC level in the three groups were 2.58±1.69 AU, 1.87±0.74 AU and 1.21±0.38 AU, respectively. Compared with the control, MDA-LDL and LDL-IC levels increased in simple RA patients and RA patients with CAD (P<0.01), furthermore, MDA-LDL and LDL-IC levels in RA patients with CAD were both found significantly higher than those in simple RA (P<0.01 or 0.05). LDL-IC level was found related with C-reactive protein (r=0.301, P=0.026), and MDA-LDL level tended to be related with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.263, P=0.057). Conclusions MDA-LDL and LDL-IC were both increased in RA patients, and may play an important role in atherocslerosis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Low birth weight (LBW) has been associated with subsequent risks of obesity and certain chronic diseases, but evidence for the associations is limited for the Chinese population. Methods: In this study we analyzed data from two population-based prospective cohort studies, the Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Shanghai Men's Health Study, to examine the associations between LBW and the risk of obesity and chronic diseases. Birth weight was self-reported at baseline; anthropometric measurements were made at study enrollment. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnoses were self-reported, whereas hypertension diagnoses were based on self-report and blood pressure measurements at baseline and follow-up surveys. Results: Birth weight was available for 11 515 men and 13 569 women. Non-linear associations were observed for birth weight with baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist: hip ratio (WHR), and waist: height ratio (WHtR; P < 0.05 for non-linearity), and LBW was linked with lower BMI, smaller WC, and larger WHR and WHtR. An excess risk of T2DM was observed for LBW (<2500 g) versus birth weight 2500-3499 g since baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.49) and since birth (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.54), whereas the HRs for hypertension since baseline and birth were 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.27) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.11-1.30), respectively. The risk of the diseases decreased as birth weight increased up to similar to 4000 g; further increases in birth weight did not convey additional benefits. Conclusion: The results suggest that LBW, an index of poor intrauterine nutrition, may affect health risks later in life in the Chinese population.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Isoflavones and lignans, two major groups of phytoestrogens, have been postulated to have multiple health benefits, including anti-estrogenic, anti-cancer, pro-cardiovascular health, and ameliorating menopausal symptoms. Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids, including daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), dihydro-daidzein, dihydrogenistein, and equol, and lignans, including enterodiol and enterolactone, have been used as biomarkers of phytoestrogen exposure in epidemiologic studies. We evaluated the urinary excretion of phytoestrogens and their correlations with lifestyle and dietary factors among 2,165 women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), a population-based prospective cohort study of 74,942 urban Chinese women aged 40-70 years at study enrollment (1996-2000). The medians (in nmol/mg creatinine) were: isoflavonoids, 17.13; daidzein, 5.57; genistein, 2.41; glycitein, 0.94; O-DMA, 1.52; dihydrodaidzein, 0.81; dihydrogenistein, 0.19; equol, 0.11; enterodiol, 0.30; and enterolactone, 1.18. These levels are 2- (enterodiol) to 126- (O-DMA) fold higher than levels among US women similar in age range with the exception of enterolactone, for which a similar level was observed for both populations. Urinary isoflavonoid excretion was higher among older women and women who engaged in regular exercise and significantly associated with soy food intake, but was inversely related to fruit intake. Urinary excretions of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, equol, enterodiol, and enterolactone were inversely associated with body mass index (BMI). Urinary excretion of isoflavones correlated with soy food intake and healthy lifestyle but was inversely associated with fruit intake among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. Our study adds important information to the rapidly growing body of research on the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Menopausal symptoms have been suggested to be an indicator of better prognosis among patients treated for breast cancer, because women who experience these symptoms usually have a lower level of estrogen. We tested this hypothesis in a population-based, prospective cohort study involving 4,842 women with stage 0 to III primary breast cancer who were enrolled in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study between March 2002 and April 2006, were aged 20 to 75 years, and were recruited 6 months post-diagnosis. They were followed-up by in-person surveys and record linkages with the vital statistics registry. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of menopausal symptoms at baseline with breast cancer recurrence. Approximately 56% of patients experienced at least one menopausal symptom, including hot flashes, night sweats, and/or vaginal dryness at baseline. During a median follow-up period of 5.3 years, 720 women had a recurrence. Experiencing hot flashes or having ≥2 menopausal symptoms was associated with lower risk of recurrence among premenopausal women (hazard ratio [HR]=0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.96 for hot flashes; 0.73, 0.56-0.96 for ≥2 menopausal symptoms). Lower recurrence risk in relation to hot flashes was also observed among women who were not overweight/obese (HR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.64-0.99), those with relatively low waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (HR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.61-0.97), and those who used tamoxifen (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.98). Consistently experiencing multiple menopausal symptoms was associated with lower recurrence risk among women with low WHR or who used tamoxifen. This large, population-based cohort study of women with breast cancer confirms that experiencing menopausal symptoms is an indicator of favorable breast cancer prognosis.',\n",

So, it is important to ensure the activity of the transplanted cells. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on neuron-likecells differentiated from mucaca multta bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells induced with cryptotanshinone in vitro. METHODS: The passage 8 mucaca multta bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were induced with cryptotanshinone to differentiate into neuron-like cells, and the percentage of apoptosis of the induced cells at different time points after induction was detected with flow cytometry (0.5 hour was one group, a total of 12 hours). The period with higher apoptosis percentage was selected to observe the effect of different concentrations of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (0-100 μg/L, totally eleven groups) on the apoptosis of the induced cells. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Cell apoptosis percentage after induction was increased gradually over time and reached a peak about 4 hours, and decreased after 1 hour (P<0.05). Cell apoptosis percentage was decreased gradually when the concentration of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor increased from 0 μg/L to 30 μg/L (P<0.05), and more remarkable change were not found when glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor concentration reached 30 μg/L.

The agents contain deep-seated modifications in the DNA binding subunits of the natural products with incorporation of a nitrogen capable of functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor (CDPBO, CDPBI) or hydrogen bond donor (CDPBI) on their inside concave face which is in intimate contact with the minor groove floor. The CDPBO subunit was prepared through use of a novel and effective MnO2- mediated oxidative coupling of 2-(benzyloxy)ethylamine with 5-hydroxyindole (4) to directly provide 2[(benzyloxy)methyl]pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzoxazole (6, 48%) in a reaction cascade that initially proceeds with amine regioselective C4 nucleophilic addition to the in situ generated p-quinone monoimine 13. Subsequent conversion of 6 to 8 (debenzylation; MnO2-NaCN, CH3OH) and selective reduction of the fused pyrrole (Et(3)SiH-CF3CO2H) completed the synthesis of the 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzoxazole-7-carboxylate ring system. The CDPBI subunit was prepared through selective C4 nitration of 22 followed by reduction of the nitro group and acid-catalyzed closure to the corresponding 2-[(benzyloxy)methyl]pyrrolo[3,2e]benzimidazole 25. The final conversion of 25 to the 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzimidazole-7-carboxylate ring system (CDPBI) followed the same protocols introduced for CDPBO. The DNA alkylation efficiencies of 2 and 3 were identical and both were substantially diminished relative to that of CBI-CDPI1 (40). Thus, the introduction of a single nitrogen atom in the DNA binding subunit of 40 has a pronounced and detrimental effect on the relative efficiency (100 x) of DNA alkylation. Consistent with these observations, the in vitro cytotoxic activity of (+)-2 and (+)-3 were comparable (IC50 200 pM, L1210) and 40 x less potent than (+)-40 (IC50 = 5 pM, L1210). In contrast to the large impact these small structural changes had on the effrciency of DNA alkylation, the selectivity of DNA alkylation by 2 and 3 was unperturbed and both agents were found to allcylate the same major sites as CBI-CDPI1 (40). The potential origin of these effects is discussed.',\n",

Four weeks after intervention,serum lipid levels were measured and morphology of aortic tissue was observed with HE staining in different groups.Expressions of NF-κB p65,Bax and Bcl-2 in aortic tissue were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.Results The serum levels of lipid were significantly higher in high fat diet group after fed for 12 weeks(P<0.01).The serum levels of TG and TC were significantly lower in pioglitazone group than in model group with smooth and intact tunica intima of atorta and no significant proliferation of smooth muscle cells was found after fed for 16 weeks(P<0.01).The expression levels of NF-κB p65 and Bax were significantly higher in model group than in control group and significantly lower in pioglitazone group than in model group(P<0.01).The expression level of Bcl-2 and the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax were significantly lower in pioglitazone group than in control group and significantly higher in-pioglitazone group than in model group(P<0.01).Conclusion High fat diet can change the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in aorta,which may be related with the increased NF-κB activity.Pioglitazone can down-regulate the serum lipid level and the expression of NF-κB p65,and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bcl-2,thus improving the function of endothelial cells and alleviating atherosclerosis.',\n",

Then pixels were classified into edge or off-edge according to combining decision rule.

Firstly, the line loss minimum conditions of a general distribution system with loop configurations are deduced. Secondly, security constraints including the permissible voltage range, the line loading limits and the UPFC ratings are considered. System security enhancement with the least increase in line loss is tackled by solving a much reduced optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The computational task of the OPF problem is reduced by deducing the security-constrained line loss minimum conditions and removing the equality constraints. Thirdly, a hybrid control scheme is proposed. Line loss minimization is achieved through a dynamic controller, while an OPF calculator is integrated to generate corrective action for the dynamic controller when the security constraints are violated. The validity of the proposed control strategies is verified in a modified IEEE 33 bus test system.',\n",

Using the concept of transient stability margin based on phase-plane trajectory concavity-convexity, the transient stability constraints are converted to generator active power constraints. Combined with the traditional optimal power flow model and constraints of VSC-MTDC system, the transient stability constrained optimal power flow model can be established. The optimization procedure is also given. According to the desired value of transient stability margin, the optimal generator active power output can be determined. The simulation results in the modified New England 39-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The valley degree of freedom in two-dimensional (2D) crystals recently emerged as a novel information carrier in addition to spin and charge. The intrinsic valley lifetime in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) is expected to be markedly long due to the unique spin-valley locking behavior, where the intervalley scattering of the electron simultaneously requires a large momentum transfer to the opposite valley and a flip of the electron spin. However, the experimentally observed valley lifetime in 2D TMDs has been limited to tens of nanoseconds thus far. We report efficient generation of microsecond-long-lived valley polarization in WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures by exploiting the ultrafast charge transfer processes in the heterostructure that efficiently creates resident holes in the WSe2 layer. These valley-polarized holes exhibit near-unity valley polarization and ultralong valley lifetime: We observe a valley-polarized hole population lifetime of more than 1 ms and a valley depolarization lifetime (that is, intervalley scattering lifetime) of more than 40 mu s at 10 K. The near-perfect generation of valley-polarized holes in TMD heterostructures, combined with ultralong valley lifetime, which is orders of magnitude longer than previous results, opens up new opportunities for novel valleytronics and spintronics applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We investigated the association of major comorbidities with breast cancer outcomes using the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study of Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer. Analyses included 4,664 women diagnosed with stage I-III incident breast cancer aged 20-75 years (median age = 51) during 2002-2006. Women were interviewed at 3-11 months post-diagnosis (median = 6.4) and followed up by in-person interviews and linkage with the vital statistics registry. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)) for the associations of comorbidities with breast cancer outcomes were estimated using Cox regression models. After a median follow-up of 5.3 years (range: 0.64-8.9), 647 women died (516 from breast cancer) and 632 recurrence/metastases were documented. The main comorbidities reported included: hypertension (22.4 %), chronic gastritis (14.3 %), diabetes mellitus (6.2 %), chronic bronchitis/asthma (5.8 %), coronary heart disease (5.0 %), and stroke (2.2 %). Diabetes was associated with increased risk of total mortality (adjusted HR: 1.40 (1.06-1.85)) and non-breast cancer mortality (adjusted HR: 2.64 (1.63-4.27)), but not breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR: 0.98 (0.68-1.41)), adjusting for socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, selected lifestyle factors, and other comorbidities. Women with a history of stroke had a non-significant increased risk of total mortality (adjusted HR: 1.42 (0.91-2.22)) and a significant increased risk of non-breast cancer mortality (adjusted HR: 2.52 (1.33-4.78)), but not breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR: 0.78 (0.38-1.62)). Overall, none of the comorbidities investigated were significantly associated with recurrence. In this large prospective cohort of breast cancer survivors, diabetes was significantly associated with increased risk of total and non-breast cancer mortality, and history of stroke was associated with increased risk of non-breast cancer mortality.',\n",

The estrogen's effects are at least partially regulated by estrogen-metabolizing enzymes. The objective of the study is to investigate associations of breast cancer survival with genetic polymorphisms in several genes involved in estrogen-metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, COMT, and AhR). Methods A cohort of 1140 patients aged between 25 and 64 years at the time of diagnosis for primary breast cancer during 1996-1998 were included in the study. Patients were followed for cancer recurrence and mortality through July 2005. Results Associations were observed at rs4680 (Met158Val) in the COMTgene and rs4646903 (CYP1A1*2A) in the CYP1A1 gene. The adjusted hazard ratio for the rs4680 AA genotype (low enzyme activity genotype) was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.4) compared with the GG genotype for disease-free survival. Adjusted hazard ratios for the rs4646903 CC genotype were 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.2) for disease-free survival and 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.1) for overall survival compared with the TT genotype. No apparent association was found for any of the other six single nucleotide polymorphisms evaluated in the AhR, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 genes. Conclusion Results from this study suggest that rs4680 in the COMTgene and rs4646903 in the CYP1A1 gene may be genetic markers for breast cancer prognosis in Chinese women.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent studies have shown that vapor phase synthesis of structurally isotropic two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 and WS2 produces well-defined domains with clean grain boundaries (GBs). This is anticipated to be vastly different for 2D anisotropic materials like ReS2 mainly due to large anisotropy in interfacial energy imposed by its distorted 1T crystal structure and formation of signature Re-chains along [010] b-axis direction. Here, we provide first insight on domain architecture on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) ReS2 domains using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, angle-resolved nano-Raman spectroscopy, reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy measurements. Results provide ways to achieve crystalline anisotropy in CVD ReS2, establish domain architecture of high symmetry ReS2 flakes, and determine Re-chain orientation within subdomains. Results also provide a first atomic resolution look at ReS2 GBs, and surprisingly we find that cluster and vacancy defects, formed by collusion of Re-chains at the GBs, dramatically impact the crystal structure by changing the Re-chain direction and rotating Re-chains 180 along their b-axis. Overall results not only shed first light on domain architecture and structure of anisotropic 2D systems but also allow one to attain much desired crystalline anisotropy in CVD grown ReS2 for the first time for tangible applications in photonics and optoelectronics where direction-dependent dichroic and linearly polarized material properties are required.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: Breast cancer survivors have a high incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures; the associated factors are understudied. We investigated incidence of bone fracture and its associations with soy food consumption, exercise, and body mass index among breast cancer survivors. Methods: This prospective study included 4139 stage 0-III breast cancer patients and 1987 pre-/perimenopausal and 2152 postmenopausal patients. Fractures were assessed at 18 months and at 3, 5, and 10 years after cancer diagnosis. Osteoporotic fractures were defined as fractures caused by falls from standing height and at sites associated with osteoporosis. Exercise and soy isoflavone intake were assessed at 6 and 18 months postdiagnosis. Weight and height were measured at baseline. Lifetable and Cox regression analyses were employed. All statistical tests were two sided. Results: The 10-year incidence for osteoporotic fractures was 2.9% and 4.4% for pre-/perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients, respectively. High soy isoflavone intake was associated with reduced risk among pre-/perimenopausal patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09 to 0.53, for soy isoflavone mg/d >= 56.06 vs <31.31; P-trend <.001) but not among postmenopausal patients (P-interaction <.01). Overweight (vs normal weight) was a risk factor for pre-/perimenopausal patients (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.04 to 3.14) but not for postmenopausal patients (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.43 to 1.03; P-interaction =.01). Exercise was inversely associated with osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal patients (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.97, for metabolic equivalents hours >= 12.6 vs <4.5) following a dose-response pattern (P-trend =.035), an association not modified by menopausal status. Conclusions: Our findings, especially the novel association of soy food intake with osteoporotic fractures in breast cancer survivors, if confirmed, can help guide future strategies for fracture risk reduction in this vulnerable population.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Obesity is a well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer, the most common gynecologic malignancy. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic markers for obesity. The authors evaluated the association of obesity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with endometrial cancer using GWAS data from their recently completed study, the Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Genetics Study, which comprised 832 endometrial cancer cases and 2,049 controls (1996-2005). Thirty-five SNPs previously associated with obesity or body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) at a minimum significance level of < 5 x 10(-7) in the US National Human Genome Research Institute\\'s GWAS catalog (\"http://genome.gov/gwastudies\" ) and representing 26 unique loci were evaluated by either direct genotyping or imputation. The authors found that for 22 of the 26 unique loci tested (84.6%), the BMI-associated risk variants were present at a higher frequency in cases than in population controls (P = 0.0003). Multiple regression analysis showed that 9 of 35 BMI-associated variants, representing 7 loci, were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the risk of endometrial cancer; for all but 1 SNP, the direction of association was consistent with that found for BMI. For consistent SNPs, the allelic odds ratios ranged from 1.15 to 1.29. These 7 loci are in the SEC16B/RASAL, TMEM18, MSRA, SOX6, MTCH2, FTO, and MC4R genes. The associations persisted after adjustment for BMI, suggesting that genetic markers of obesity provide value in addition to BMI in predicting endometrial cancer risk.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: Data from in vitro and animal studies support a protective role for tea in the etiology of digestive system cancers; however, results from prospective cohort studies have been inconsistent. In addition, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the association of tea consumption with the incidence of all digestive system cancers in Chinese women. Objective: We investigated the association of regular tea intake (>= 3 times/wk for > 6 mo) with risk of digestive system cancers. Design: We used the Shanghai Women's Health Study, a population-based prospective cohort study of middle-aged and older Chinese women who were recruited in 1996-2000. Adjusted HRs and associated 95% CIs were derived from Cox regression models. Results: After a mean follow-up of 11 y, 1255 digestive system cancers occurred (stomach, esophagus, colorectal, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder/bile duct cancers) in 69,310 nonsmoking and non-alcohol-drinking women. In comparison with women who never drank tea, regular tea intake (mostly green tea) was associated with reduced risk of all digestive system cancers combined (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.98), and the reduction in risk increased as the amount and years of tea consumption increased (P-trend = 0.01 and P-trend < 0.01, respectively). For example, women who consumed >= 150 g tea/mo (similar to 2-3 cups/d) had a 21% reduced risk of digestive system cancers combined (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.99). The inverse association was found primarily for colorectal and stomach/esophageal cancers. Conclusion: In this large prospective cohort study, tea consumption was associated with reduced risk of colorectal and stomach/esophageal cancers in Chinese women.

While applying this method, the power inverter can not only output power in the grid- connected scenario, but also automatically produce power to satisfy the power demand or non-power demand about the load and power-sharing among inverters when the islanding and stand-alone events take place. It overcomes some traditional power inverter shortcoming that it can not make micro-grid smooth transition from grid-connected to islanding and to stand-alone status, due to the delay during different strategies being switched.

       "  'abstract': \"Vegetation pattern in lowlands between active sand dunes has rarely been studied, but it may play an important role in maintaining the biodiversity This paper aims to quantify relationships between lowland area and species richness, composition and vegetation distribution and to provide suggestions on biodiversity conservation in the active dune field. Considering each interdune lowland as a self-contained unit, we investigated species composition and vegetation pattern in 25 interdune lowlands (ranging from 0.06 ha to 9.5 ha) of an active sand dune field. Our results showed that species richness increased with lowland area following a power function. The richness of psammophytes relative to the overall species richness decreased with lowland area logarithmically, but increase in lowland area did not lead to significant decrease in psammophyte's richness. With decrease of lowland area, frequency of psammophytes logarithmically increased, but that of nonpsammophytes logarithmically decreased. When the lowland area was about 2 ha, frequency of the psammophytes was equal to that of the nonpsammophytes (limnocryptophyte-meadow species and steppe species). Furthermore, a consistent pattern of vegetation differentiation along the direction of dune advancement occurred for lowlands larger than I ha: a psammophyte zone near the foot of leeward slope, a limnocryptophyte-meadow species zone in the central part of interdune lowland, and then followed by a psammophyte zone towards the foot of the windward slope. We concluded that lowland size is an important determinant of species diversity and vegetation pattern, and thus has implications for biodiversity conservation in sand dune fields.

       "  'abstract': 'This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism by which curcumin inhibits tumor growth and reduces vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in a murine choroidal melanoma model. Sixty mice were given subretinal injection with B16F10 cells and divided into a treatment and a control group. Curcumin was administered to the treatment group once a day at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 18 days starting at d3 (the day of inoculation is designated as d0); an equivalent volume of poloxamer-F68 was administered to the control group. Immunohistochemical and histochemical double staining were ued to detect the different blood supply patterns. The amounts of epithelial cell kinase (EphA2), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and matrixmetalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2, MMP-9) proteins expressed in the tumor tissue were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining; mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR analysis. Results indicate that the tumor volume is reduced (p = 0.000) and that the numbers of VM (p = 0.000), mosaic vessels (p = 0.031) and endotheliumdependent vessels (p = 0.000) are significantly decreased by curcumin (p = 0.001). The expression levels of EphA2, PI3K, MMP-2 and -9 are also lower in the treatment group than in the control group (p = 0.001); similarly, mRNA levels in the treatment group are lower than those in the control group (p = 0.000). In conclusion, curcumin has the ability to inhibit the growth of engrafted melanoma VM channels through the regulation of vasculogenic factors that could be related to the downregulation of the EphA2/PI3K/MMPs signaling pathway. Thus, curcumin has the potential of being a clinical inhibitor of VM of choroidal melanoma. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to share the route of transmission, the prevalence of co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is high with chronic HBV infection affecting nearly 10% of HIV-infected patient world wide, which has become a significant global health problem. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with HBV/HIV-1 co-infection are largely unclear. In this study, we provided evidence that HBV induces HIV-1 transcription through its X protein (HBx). We further explored the mechanism by which HBx activates HIV-1 transcription. Our results showed that C/EBP and CRE cis-regulatory elements in the long terminal repeats (LTR) of HIV-1 are required for the activation of HIV-1 transcription mediated by HBx. We also demonstrated that HBx regulates HIV-1 transcription through stimulating the binding of transcriptional regulatory proteins C/EBPβ, CREB1, and CREB2 to HIV-1 LTR and that co-activator CBP is required for such regulation. These findings provide new insights into our understanding the effect of HBx on the activation of HIV-1 transcription and also provide evidence of the potential role of HBV in HIV-1 replication during the course of HBV/HIV-1 co-infection.',\n",

Conventional control strategy is to apply the PID control to achieve automatic control of the feeding volume and the amount of steam, but the quality of feed particles can not be guaranteed. In this paper, a control strategy of machine vision based networked supervisory control is proposed. Firstly, the feeding volume and the amount of steam is collected and controlled by the embedded technology. Secondly, a threshold segmentation algorithm based machine vision technology is used to detect the defects of feed particles. A machine vision based networked supervisory control mechanism is deployed through the RS-485 bus to adjusts the control effect and ensure high quality feed particles being produced. Simulation experiments were conducted on the independent software and hardware platform, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed networked supervisory control.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also named SARS-CoV-2) has spread from Wuhan to outside of Hubei province and other countries or regions, caused thousands of patients with disease named “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)”, and led to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by World Health Organization (WHO). The person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 was reported among close contacts.Methods: To investigate the early epidemic of COVID-19, totally 176 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shiyan city, Hubei province, China were surveyed. Their traces of activities and contacts were tracked and analyzed. Among the 176 confirmed cases, 53 patients were admitted to the Shiyan Renmin Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine. The clinical characteristics on the 53 patients were collected and compared based on the nucleotides and pneumonia in laboratory inspection.Findings: The early confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hubei province outside Wuhan were emerged by migrate rate-dependent, and the second-generation patients were mainly cluster-onset between family members from Wuhan travelers. Epidemiological investigation indicated that 10.7% (12/112) of local COVID-19 cases were transferred SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic infected individuals. Clinical data showed that 47.2% (25/53) of the COVID-19 patients were co-infected with the Meningococcal pneumonia. Interpretation: It should be paid more attentions to the high incidence of coinfections with M. pneumoniae in the COVID-19 patients. It is necessary to assess the transmissibility of asymptomatic infected individuals and other possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The strict intervention measures should be adopted by the public to lower basic reproduction number and stop the spread.Funding Statement: This work was supported by research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81902066, 81730061, and 81471942), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Provincial Department of Education (Q20192105 and Q20192104), the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2018CFB185 and 2018CFB093), Cultivating Project for Young Scholar at Hubei University of Medicine (2017QDJZR08 and 2016QDJZR03), and National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (201913249002).

       "  'abstract': \"Based on the information from collected literatures, this paper defined the geographical distribution of Kobresia in China, and analyzed the relationships between the Kobresia's species richness and climatic factors. The Kobresia in China had higher species richness on the borders of Yunnan Province, Sichuan Province, and Tibet Autonomous Region and in the southeast Qinghai Province and Himalayas, with a denser and wider distribution in the areas of < 40 degrees N, 85 degrees-105 degrees E and > altitude 2500 m, or the areas of lower or medium thermal factors, medium precipitation, medium aridity and humidity, or medium sunshine duration. The species richness was significantly negatively correlated with the mean, maximum, and minimum air temperature in July and the mean air temperature in summer (P < 0.05), and well corresponded to the isolines of warmth index, annual biotemperature, extreme maximum air temperature, air temperature in summer, and mean, maximum, and minimum air temperature in July. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the maximum air temperature in July and the precipitation in spring had significant effects on the species richness (P<0.05) , with the greatest contribution of the maximum air temperature in July. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that the mean air temperature in July and the mean annual maximum and extreme maximum air temperature had significant effects on the species richness (P < 0.05), and the principal component regression analysis indicated that the extreme maximum air temperature, air temperature in July and summer, Thornthwaite aridity index, sunshine hours in April-October, precipitation in summer and autumn, and annual precipitation had greater effects on the richness. The air temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours in growth season as well as the extreme maximum air temperature, annual precipitation, and soil moisture content were the main factors affecting the geographical distribution of Kobresia in China.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Analysis of developmental genetic effects for brown rice thickness (BRT) trait in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) at four different filling stages was conducted and a developmental genetic model and corresponding statistical approaches for quantitative traits of triploid endosperm in cereal crops was used. The results indicated that the diploid maternal plant, triploid endosperm and cytoplasmic genetic effects were important for BRT trait at all filling stages of rice and those effects were the major effect at initial medium, filling period and mature period respectively. The additive and dominance effects were the major effect alternatively at four filling stages of rice. Significant endosperm and maternal dominance effects for BRT suggest that the utilization of heterosis for BRT is viable. The results of conditional genetic variance components shown that the expression of new quantitative genes in endosperm, cytoplasm and maternal plant for BRT was found at most filling stages of rice. The gene expression was most active at the early filling stages, especially at the second stage (8-∼ 14 days after flowering). Near to mature period (22∼ 28 days after flowering), however, the expression of genes decreased sharply and even closed. The phenomena that the genes expressed spasmodically, i.e. the net genetic effects equaled to zero in some filling stages were detected for some genetic effects. Dominance and cytoplasmic correlation coefficients were significant at 0.05 or 0.01 probability level in some filling stages meanwhile there were the most strong relationship between mature period and other periods for BRT.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Exosomes are a class of cell-released small vesicles that mediate intercellular communication by delivering functional factors to recipient cells. During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the interaction between liver resident macrophages and hepatocytes is a key component in liver innate immunity. In this study, we explored the role of exosomes in the delivery of innate anti-HCV factors to hepatocytes from macrophages. We showed that supernatant from TLR3-activated macrophage cultures could efficiently inhibit HCV replication in Huh7 cells. This macrophage-mediated anti-HCV activity was through exosomes because inhibiting exosomes could abrogate the action of macrophages. Further analyses demonstrated that TLR3-activated macrophages release exosomes that contain anti-HCV microRNA (miRNA)-29 family members. Inhibiting miRNA29 could restore HCV replication. These findings suggest a novel antiviral mechanism in liver innate immunity against HCV infection and provide insights to support further studies on developing exosome-based delivery system for disease treatment.-Zhou, Y., Wang, X., Sun, L., Zhou, L., Ma, T.-C., Song, L., Wu, J.-G., Li, J.-L., Ho, W.-Z.

       "  'abstract': 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide, often leading to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway is responsible for approximately 30% of cancers. Here we attempted to address the correlation between activation of this pathway and HCV replication. We showed that knockdown of Raf1 inhibits HCV replication, while activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway by V12, a constitutively active form of Ras, stimulates HCV replication. We further demonstrated that this effect is regulated through attenuation of the interferon (IFN)-JAK-STAT pathway. Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway downregulates the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), attenuates the phosphorylation of STAT1/2, and inhibits the expression of interferon (alpha, beta, and omega) receptors 1 and 2 (IFNAR1/2). Furthermore, we observed that HCV infection activates the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. Thus, we propose that during HCV infection, the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway is activated, which in turn attenuates the IFN-JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in stimulation of HCV replication.',\n",

The stress values on the artificial bone surface for the tantalum rod implant model inside the osteonecrosis area and the shortening implant model exhibited statistical significance (p&amp;lt;0.01).Tantalum rod implantation into the osteonecrosis area can reduce the collapse values in the weight-bearing area when osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) was in a certain range, thereby obtaining better clinical effects. When ONFH was in a large range (120°), the tantalum rod implantation inside the osteonecrosis area, shortening implant or fibula implant can reduce the collapse values of the femoral head, as assessed by other methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal modulators of plant development and host-virus interactions. However, the roles and action modes of specific miRNAs involved in viral infection and host susceptibility remain largely unclear. In this study, we show that Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) infection caused increased accumulation of miR319 but decreased expression of miR319-regulated TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) genes, especially TCP21, in rice plants. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR319 or downregulating TCP21 exhibited disease-like phenotypes\\xa0and showed significantly higher susceptibility to RRSV in comparison with the wild-type plants. In contrast, only mild disease symptoms were observed in RRSV-infected lines overexpressing TCP21 and especially in the transgenic plants overexpressing miR319-resistant TCP21. Both RRSV infection and overexpression of miR319 caused the decreased endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) levels along with downregulated expression of JA biosynthesis and signaling-related genes in rice. However, treatment of rice plants with methyl jasmonate\\xa0alleviated disease symptoms caused by RRSV and\\xa0reduced virus accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that the induction of miR319 by RRSV infection in rice suppresses JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection and symptom development. ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   Environmental inequalities are a common characteristic of urban areas. Environmental inequality is the unequal spatial distribution of environmental risks and goods among social groups. As environmental inequalities are inherently a spatial matter the choice of scale is essential for correctly understanding inequality issues and for designing proper and effective mitigation policies. However, the potential effects of scale of analysis on inequalities results have largely been underestimated in the assessment of environmental inequalities, leading to contradictory results from different studies. In this study we assess the patterns of environmental inequalities and associated scale issues in the city of Santiago (Chile) using a hierarchical multiscale approach. Our approach focuses on the analysis of spatial relationships between three environmental (i.e., surface temperature, air pollution, vegetation cover) and two socio-demographic variables (i.e., household wealth, population density) on multiple grain sizes and extents. We used census data, remote sensing data, and air pollution monitoring stations to generate raster layers at five grain sizes and five nested extents. We tested for inequalities through Pearson correlation analysis resulting in a total of 1530 assessed relationships. Our results show that environmental inequalities are a prevalent phenomenon in the city of Santiago, but the details of these inequalities are highly scale dependent. Changing the grain size and extent of analysis do not only affect the strength of relationships between socio-demographic and environmental variables, but also the spatial distribution of environmental inequalities across the urban landscape. Therefore, due to the scale-dependence of assessment results, researchers and decision-makers should be extremely careful when interpreting their findings and translating them into policy making. If the scale dependency of environmental inequalities is not taken into account, policy interventions may be largely ineffective because the scale at which interventions are designed may not match the scale at which inequalities are generated.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A factorial mating design in two environments was conducted using 7 cytoplasmic male sterile lines (A) and 5 restorer lines (R) along with their F1 (A × R) and F2 populations. The unconditional and conditional analyses of genetic models and the cor- responding statistic methods, including endospermic, cytoplasmic, and maternal plant genetic systems, were used to analyze the genetic relationships between protein content (PC) and the appearance quality traits of indica rice (Oryza sativa L.). The results from unconditional analysis indicated that PC was significantly correlated with the appearance quality traits of rice, except for the brown rice thickness (BRT). Only the genetic covariance between PC and the brown rice width (BRW) was positively correlative, whereas all the other pairwise traits were negatively correlative. The results from conditional analysis revealed that the weight of brown rice (WBR) or the amylose content (AC) could significantly affect the relationships between PC and the appearance quality traits of indica rice. The conditional analysis showed that WBR might negatively affect the relationships between PC and the brown rice length (BRL), BRW, or BRT through the genotype × environmental (GE) interaction effects, but positively affected the rela- tionships between PC and the ratio of brown rice length to width (RLW) or the ratio of brown rice length to thickness (RLT).

       "  'title': 'Simulating the dynamics of primary productivity of a Sonoran ecosystem: Model parameterization and validation',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Modeling has played a crucial role in understanding the structural and functional dynamics of forest and grassland ecosystems in the past decades, but relatively few ecosystem models have been developed for deserts. Adapting an existing desert ecosystem model to new regions with different community components and environmental settings may testify to the generality of model applicability, further verify model structure and formulations, and provide new insight into understanding desert ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we use a desert ecosystem model that was originally developed for the Chihuahuan Desert, Patch Arid Land Simulator-Functional Types (PALS-FT), to estimate the aboveground annual net primary productivity (ANPP) of a creosotebush ( Larrea tridentata )-dominated Sonoran Desert ecosystem in the Phoenix metropolitan area, home to the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research Project (CAP LTER). We modified and parameterized the model using meteorological data, ecophysiological parameters for different plant functional types, and site characteristic data from the CAP LTER study area and an independent test site in the San Simon Valley of southeastern Arizona. Model predictions were validated and calibrated using field observations from the San Simon Valley test site. The results showed that PALS-FT was able to simulate ANPP of this typical Sonoran Desert ecosystem reasonably well, with a relative error of ±2.4% at the ecosystem level and generally less than ±25% at the functional-type level. We then used the model to simulate ANPP and its seasonal and inter-annual dynamics for a similar ecosystem in the CAP LTER study area. The model predicted average annual ANPP of 72.3 g m −2 y −1 , ranging from 11.3 g m −2 y −1 to 229.6 g m −2 y −1 in a 15-year simulation. The simulated average ANPP of the Sonoran Desert ecosystem is close to field observations in other areas of the Sonoran Desert, and the range of variation also is close to that reported by other researchers for arid and semiarid ecosystems. The dynamics of ecosystem ANPP in response to fluctuations in annual precipitation simulated by the model agreed well with the known relationship between ANPP and precipitation in arid and semiarid systems. A closer examination of this relationship at the level of plant functional types further revealed that seasonal distribution of rainfall significantly affected ANPP. A comparison between the PALS-FT model prediction and two regression models for North American warm deserts showed that both regression models underestimated the Larrea ecosystem ANPP, while the process-based PALS-FT model provided the most accurate prediction among the three models. This study provides a validation for use of the PALS-FT model to investigate Sonoran desert ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Keywords Net primary productivity Sonoran Desert Larrea PALS-FT Model parameterization Model validation Long-term ecological research 1 Introduction Arid and semiarid regions occupy over one third of the world's land surface and are home to more than 20% of the global human population ( Reynolds and Smith, 2002 ). Many drylands have been degraded by overcultivation, overgrazing, fuel gathering, urbanization, and climate change ( Schlesinger et al., 1990; Wu, 2001; Reynolds and Smith, 2002 ). With the accelerating rate of desertification around the world, especially in Africa and central Asia, the capacity of arid lands to support humans, livestock, and wild animals is decreasing substantially. Understanding the basic functioning of desert ecosystems is thus of paramount importance to combating desertification and supporting sustainable use of arid land. An important indicator of ecosystem functioning is aboveground net primary productivity. It not only reflects how well the primary producers of an ecosystem are growing, but also indicates the amount of energy available to consumers and decomposers that, in turn, drive other important ecosystem processes (e.g. biogeochemical cycles, decomposition). The primary production of desert ecosystems has been a major research topic for decades ( Noy-Meir, 1973; Fischer and Turner, 1978; Hadley and Szarek, 1981; Ludwig, 1987; Whitford, 2002 ). Studies have investigated water-use efficiency ( Webb et al., 1978; LeHouerou et al., 1988 ), below-ground productivity ( Caldwell and Camp, 1974; Bell et al., 1979 ), relationships between productivity and rainfall variability ( Ludwig, 1986; LeHouerou et al., 1988 ), and productivity of individual species or functional groups ( Chew and Chew, 1965; Burk and Dick-Peddie, 1973; Whittaker and Niering, 1975; Johnson et al., 1978; Reynolds et al., 1980, 1997; Fisher et al., 1988; Turner and Randall, 1989 ). While these studies, based on field observations and measurements, provide valuable insight into desert ecosystem processes, the generally short duration of the studies often limits the ability to obtain a clear understanding of cause and effect relationship that govern productivity in these highly temporally variable ecosystems. Thus, ecosystem simulation is a potentially powerful tool to aid in the understanding of ecosystem functioning, especially with respect to temporal processes such as climate variability and atmospheric change (e.g. changes in precipitation patterns, CO 2 , N deposition), as well as other human perturbations and management activities. However, model development with respect to desert ecosystems has lagged behind that compared with some other ecosystems, e.g. forest and grasslands (see Tiktak and van Grinsven, 1995; Ryan et al., 1996; Parton et al., 1996 ). Models for estimating terrestrial ANPP can be categorized into three types: statistical models, parametric models, and process models ( Reynolds et al., 1993; Ruimy et al., 1994 ), in which process-based models are generally considered to be more useful for understanding the mechanisms of plant growth and plant-environment interactions, and for extrapolating predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Most ecosystem models for desert ecosystems are either statistical (e.g. Noy-Meir, 1973; Webb et al., 1978; LeHouerou et al., 1988 ) or process models (e.g. Reynolds et al., 1980, 1997; Reynolds and Cunningham, 1981 ). The Patch Arid Land Simulator-Functional Types (PALS-FT) is a mechanistic process-based model developed originally for the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem in the Jornada Basin, New Mexico, USA ( Reynolds et al., 1997 ). It has been used to study effects of disturbances on grassland-shrubland transition ( Gao and Reynolds, 2003 ), effects of rainfall variability on canopy transpiration and soil water dynamics ( Reynolds et al., 2000 ), and ecosystem responses to climate change in the Chihuanhuan Desert ( Reynolds et al., 1997 ). Applying the model and expanding these studies to new regions, longer time frames, and/or new types of environmental changes (e.g. urbanization-induced environmental changes) can further verify the structural rationality and predictive accuracy of the model and provide new insight into desert ecosystem functioning. As part of the effort to understand and predict how urbanization affects ecosystem processes in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, USA, a city in the Sonoran Desert (see Grimm et al., 2000 ), the main objective of this study was to adapt and evaluate the PALS-FT model for the Sonoran desert, which boasts the highest plant diversity among the four North American Deserts (Sonoran, Chihuahuan, Mojave, and the Great Basin). This is due in part to the presence of both summer and winter showers in the Sonoran Desert compared to predominately summer rainfall in the Chihuanhuan Desert and winter rainfall in the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts ( Brown, 1994; MacMahon, 2000 ). Specifically, we sought to determine whether the PALS-FT model can be applied to simulate the ecosystem ANPP of the Larrea dominated Sonoran Desert ecosystem with acceptable accuracy and consistency against field observations. We first briefly describe the structure and formulations of the PALS-FT model including modifications for application to the Sonoran Desert. The model parameter development and evaluation was accomplished using data from an independent testing site in the southeastern Sonoran Desert. The model was then used to examine seasonal and inter-annual patterns of ANPP in response to precipitation fluctuations over the northwest CAP study area of the Sonoran Desert. The PALS-FT model predictions were also compared with those of regression models that had been developed for the North American hot deserts, and the potential uses of the model to investigate urbanization effects on desert ecosystem function are discussed. 2 Model description PALS-FT is a physiologically based ecosystem model that simulates the dynamics of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water (H 2 O) cycling of a desert ecosystem in a daily time step, with explicit consideration of plant functional types (FTs) of shrub, subshrub, perennial grasses, forbs, C3 winter-annual, and C4 summer-annual species ( Reynolds and Cunningham, 1981; Reynolds et al., 1993, 1997, 2000; Kemp et al., 1997 ). The model was developed based on the hypothesis that changes in ecosystem structure and function are determined primarily by the dynamics of different plant FTs and soil resource distributions ( Reynolds et al., 1997 ). PALS-FT consists of four interacting modules: (i) atmospheric driving variables and surface energy budget, (ii) soil water distribution and water cycling, (iii) production of plant FTs, and (iv) nutrient (C, N) cycling. PALS-FT is similar to patch-dynamic models (e.g. Shugart, 1984; Wu and Levin, 1994, 1997 ) in that it simulates ecological processes on a “patch” of certain size. The patch size used for PALS is variable, depending upon the desired resolution, FT composition, and interaction among adjacent patches. Previous studies using PALS-FT considered relatively small patch sizes (ca. 1–30 m 2 ) in order to investigate small-scale spatial heterogeneity along a topographic gradient ( Reynolds et al., 1997, 2004; Gao and Reynolds, 2003 ). But in this study, we treated the “patch” as a generalized ecosystem unit at the scale of 1–100 km 2 for the purpose of representing a geographic area with relatively homogeneous abiotic conditions and similar ecosystem components. Model inputs and initialization includes data on climatic conditions, soil physical properties, plant and soil C and N storage, and plant ecophysiological parameters. Major model output variables include ANPP, soil evaporation, canopy transpiration, vegetation cover, soil organic matter, and soil C and N mineralization. Because PALS-FT has already been described in previous studies ( Reynolds et al., 1997, 2000, 2004 ), we provide only an overview of the general model, focusing on the elements that were modified or are particularly relevant to the objectives of our study. 2.1 Atmospheric driving variables and surface energy budget This module includes inputs of environmental driving variables (e.g. daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, solar radiation, relative humidity, ambient CO 2 concentration, and N deposition rate) and the calculation of other environmental variables using these input driving variables (e.g. day length or photoperiod, mean air temperatures, soil temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Photoperiod is calculated as a cosine function of Julian day: (1) Photoperiod = 12 + 2 cos π × Julian \\u2009\\u200a\\u200a day − 172 182.5 VPD, an important variable in determining stomatal conductance, is the difference between saturated vapor pressure (VP sat ) and measured vapor pressure (VP air ) corresponding to maximum air temperature ( T max, in °C), i.e. (2) VPD ( T max ) = V P sat ( T max ) − V P air and (3) V P sat ( T max ) = 0.611 × 10 ( ( 7.5 × T max ) / ( 237.3 + T max ) ) (4) V P air = rh × V P sat ( T max ) where rh is the relative humidity (%). Surface soil temperature (at 1 cm depth) is estimated using the following empirical equations: (5) S T max = T max + 0.962 × R s − 6.63 (6) S T min = T min − 0.55 (7) S T avg = 0.77 × S T max + S T min 2 where ST max , ST min and ST avg are the maximum, minimum and average surface soil temperature (°C), respectively, T max and T min are the maximum and minimum air temperature (°C), respectively, and R s the total solar radiation (MJ m −2 day −1 ). The belowground average daily soil temperature is calculated for a relatively deep point (200 cm) using a sinusoidal function given by Campbell (1977; equation 2.8) with a mean annual deep soil temperature of 20 °C (200 cm), a surface (−1 cm) annual amplitude of mean daily temperature of 13.7 °C, and an average annual damping depth of 170 cm (which corresponds to an average thermal diffusivity of 0.003 cm 2 /s) and a phase adjustment of 91 Julian days for occurrence of mean daily surface (−1 cm) temperature. This same equation is used to calculate the soil temperature at a shallow point (50 cm) by including a site-specific harmonic term to account for asymmetry nearer the surface. Soil temperatures at depths from the surface to 50 cm are determined by interpolation of the logarithmic decay the surface temperature (Eq. (7) ) to the predicted daily mean temperature at 50 cm; and soil temperatures from 50 to 200 cm are predicted by interpolation of the logarithmic decay between these two depths. 2.2 Soil water distribution and water cycling module The water cycling module simulates daily soil evaporation, plant transpiration, and water content and movement in different soil layers ( Fig. 1 ). The water reaching the soil surface of the patch, “effective precipitation” (EP, in cm d −1 ), is estimated as a function of actual precipitation (Ppt), interception, run on, and run off, i.e. (8) EP = Ppt − intcpt + runon − runoff (9) intcpt = SS × 2 × LA I t where SS is the surface storage of water film on foliage (ave. for all FTs is ca. 0.02 cm; Reynolds et al., 2000 ), 2 is a factor accounting for the two sides of the leaf, and LAI t is the total leaf area index (m 2 m −2 ) including all plant functional types (as in Kemp et al., 1997 ). Water run-on and run-off in the simulated patch were not considered because of the negligible slope (<1%) in northwestern Phoenix and our testing site ( Fig. 4 ). Soil water is represented in 6 layers in the PALS-FT model: the upper two layers with a depth of 10 cm each and the other 4 layers with a depth of 20 cm each. Water infiltration of each layer is determined by the amount of water percolating out of the upper layer, previous water content, and water holding capacity (WHC) of the layer. Water is removed from the two top layers by evaporation and from all layers by transpiration. Evaporation is determined by soil water availability (soil water potential and relative water content, RWC) and energy available at the soil surface. Water taken up by plants is partitioned among the soil layers according to the proportions of roots in each layer for all FTs. Actual canopy transpiration is estimated by a simple energy budget model and a canopy stomatal resistance function ( Kemp et al., 1997; Reynolds et al., 2000 ). 2.3 Plant production module PALS-FT's plant production module simulates plant phenology, growth, and C allocation to different plant parts ( Fig. 2 ). Plant growth, litter fall, and plant mortality are influenced by FT-specific patterns of phenology that are controlled by water availability and extreme temperatures. The plant production module for C3 and C4 annuals and perennial grasses differs slightly from Fig. 2 in its inclusion of seed germination and reproduction for the annual FTs and regrowth from roots/rhizomes for grasses. The amount of daily plant growth for all FTs ( G j , in g dry mass m −2 ) is calculated in the same way: (10) G i = X lvs × SLA × A max , j × 12 0.46 × ( 1 − R loss ) × F c × F t where X lvs is the leaf dry mass (g), SLA the specific leaf area (m 2 g −1 ), A max, j the maximum potential net photosynthetic rate (mol CO 2 m −2 s −1 ), the value of 12 is the mass of 12 g C/mol CO 2 , 0.46 is the average C content (46%) in plant tissues, R loss the respiratory loss of photosynthetic production per day, F t the temperature influence factor (for forbs and grasses, not for shrubs), and F c (=2/ π × photoperiod × 3600) is a conversion factor (changing time unit from second to day; Monteith and Unsworth, 1990 ). The annual growth of plants calculated from Eq. (10) can be summed over the year (or season for annual FTs) and reduced by allocation to above-ground plant material to obtain a measure of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP; herbivory is considered insignificant in the model). A max, j is estimated using the following equation ( Ehleringer, 1983 ): (11) A max , j = g j 1.6 × Ca − C i j p where g j is the stomatal conductance (mol H 2 O m −2 s −1 ), Ca the partial pressure of atmospheric CO 2 concentration (kPa), and Ci j the partial pressure of intercellular CO 2 (kPa), 1.6 is the ratio of diffusivity of H 2 O (21.2 × 10 −6 ) to CO 2 (12.9 × 10 −6 ), p is the atmospheric vapor pressure (kPa) The value of Ci j is assumed to be determined by the physiological/anatomical capacity of each FT (Ci min, j ), and is assumed to be affected by leaf N levels ( S j N ): (12) C i j = Ca − ( Ca − C i min , j ) × S j N and S j N is a linear scalar accounting for the effect of leaf N on Ci j of FT j . S j N is defined as: (13) S j N = \\u2003 \\u2009 \\u2003 1 i f \\u2009 N L > 1 \\u2003 \\u2009 \\u2009 0.1 i f \\u2009 N L < 0.1 N leaf − N min leaf N max leaf − N min leaf ( = N L ) i f \\u2009 0.1 ≤ N L ≤ 1 where N leaf is the currently simulated leaf N fraction, and N max leaf and N min leaf are the maximum and minimum possible leaf N fractions. Calculation of A max requires a value for stomatal conductance ( g j ). While many photosynthesis models employ schemes for predicting g in relation to feedback from carbon uptake (e.g. Ball et al., 1987; Leuning, 1995 ), other successful stomatal models have considered that g is a function of leaf water potential, VPD, light, or temperature (e.g. Jarvis, 1976; Oren et al., 1999 ). The PALS-FT model assumes that the overriding factors controlling stomatal conductance in desert plants is plant water potential (leaf hydration) and atmospheric vapor deficit (see Kemp et al., 1997 ). Thus, g j is calculated as an exponential function of FT leaf water potential ( Ψ j ) with a linear relationship to decreasing atmospheric vapor deficit (VPD in kPa): (14) g j = a × e ( b × Ψ j ) × ( 1 − 0.1 × VPD ) with a and b as FT-specific parameters defining the exponential decline in g j with decreasing Ψ j ( Table A.2 ). A daily value for leaf water potential of each FT ( Ψ j ) is calculated from the water potential of all soil layers weighted by the fraction of roots of each FT in each specific layer (see Kemp et al., 1997 ). 2.4 Nutrient cycling module The nutrient cycling module simulates the dynamics of C and N in the soil-plant-atmosphere system ( Fig. 3 ), and is a modified version of the nutrient cycling part of the CENTURY model ( Parton et al., 1988, 1993 ). Three kinds of plant litter are distinguished for each of the FTs: leaf litter, stem litter, and root litter; with the leaf and stem litter being allocated to one of two chemical pools on the soil surface (metabolic or structural C) and root litter being allocated to one of two pools in the belowground soil (also metabolic or structural C). The partitioning of litter into metabolic or structural fractions was based on literature values of residual chemical composition of litter types for each FT (see Kemp et al., 2003 ): (15) d C m , i d t = ∑ j = 1 6 d L i , j d t × Me t i , j × F c , j ,  for \\u2009 metabolic \\u2009 material (16) d C s , i d t = ∑ j = 1 6 d L i , j d t × ( 1 − Me t i , j ) × F c , j \\u2009 for \\u2009 structural \\u2009 material where i = 1, 2, 3 for leaf, stem and root, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for the 6 plant functional types, C m ,i and C s ,i are the C contents ( g ) in metabolic and structural material, respectively, L i,j is the litter dry mass in each litter type i-FT j combination, Met i , j is the fraction of metabolic material, and F c, j is the fraction of C content of litter type i (in dry mass) of FT j . The input rates of N from plant litter to metabolic ( N m ) and structural material ( N s ) pools are modeled similarly to C : (17) d N m , i d t = ∑ j 6 d L i , j d t × N i , j − d N s , i d t , \\u2009 for \\u2009 metabolic \\u2009 material (18) d N s , i d t = ∑ j = 1 6 d L i , j d t × ( 1 − Me t i , j ) × F c , j × N C i , j , \\u2009 for \\u2009 structural \\u2009 material where i , j , L i , j , F c, j , and Met i , j are the same as in Eqs (15) and (16) , N i,j is the N content (% of dry mass) of litter type i of FT j , and ( N / C ) i , j is the ratio of N to C for litter type i of FT j . After decomposition, the metabolic and structural material of plant litter enters into one of the three soil organic matter (SOM) pools: surface litter enters the surface active organic matter (SAOM), and belowground litter enters the active soil organic matter (ASOM) or slow soil organic matter (SSOM) according to the partitioning scheme employed in CENTURY ( Parton et al., 1993 ), and a small fraction of the C from the soil organic matter pools enters the passive soil organic matter (PSOM). The flows of C from metabolic and structural material pools to the three SOM pools and among the SOM pools are depicted in Fig. 3 and are defined by the following differential equations ( Parton et al., 1993 ): (19) d C i d t = K i × L C × A × C i , \\u2003 i = 1 , 2 (20) d C i d t = K i × A × T m × C i , \\u2003 i = 3 (21) d C i d t = K i × A × C i , \\u2003 i = 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 where C i is the C in the state variable i ; i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 denote surface (leaf and stem) structural material, root structural material, active soil organic matter, surface-active organic matter, surface metabolic material, soil metabolic material, slow soil organic matter fractions, and passive soil organic matter fractions, respectively; K i is the maximum decomposition rate (day −1 ) for the i th state variable ( Table A.1 ); L C the impact of lignin content of structural material on its decomposition, T m is the effect of soil texture on ASOM turnover, and A is the combined abiotic impact of soil moisture and soil temperature on decomposition (product of the soil moisture and temperature terms). Calculations of L C , T m , and A are as in Parton et al. (1993) . The dynamics of N in decomposing organic matter is coupled directly to the flows of C through the various SOM pools. The flow of N among these pools is equal to the product of the C flows and the N/C ratio of the recipient state variable ( Parton et al., 1993 ). Specifically, the following differential equations describe the dynamics of organic N among different pools: (22) d N i d t = 1 − L S i × ( 1 − F lab , min ) × d C i d t × N C i + L S i × ( 1 − F lig , min ) × d C i d t × N C i \\u2003 i = 1 , 2 (23) d N i d t = ( 1 − T m ) × d C i d t × N C i \\u2003 i = 3 (24) d N i d t = ( 1 − F lab , min ) × d C i d t × ( N / C ) i \\u2003 i = 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 where N i is N in state variable i ; i represent the same organic pools as in Eqs. (19)–(21) ; ( L / S ) i the ratio of lignin content to the summation of lignin and cellulose material in the i th organic pool ( Table A.2 ); ( N / C ) i the ratio of N to C for the i th organic matter pool and calculated in each time step of simulation; F lab,min is the fraction of N in labile material lost due to microbial respiration ( Table A.2 ); F lig,min is the fraction of N in non-labile material (i.e. lignin and cellulose) lost due to microbial respiration ( Table A.2 ); T s the effect of soil texture on organic N turnover ( Parton et al., 1993 ). For different organic matter pools, N associated with C lost in respiration is assumed to be mineralized. Nitrogen mineralization rates are also the products of the decomposition rates (d C i /d t ) of corresponding carbon pools, the fraction of respiratory N loss ( F lab,min ), and N / C ratio. Thus, we have: (25) d N i , min d t = 1 − L S i × ( F lab , min ) × d C i d t × N C i + L S i × ( F lig , min ) × d C i d t × N C i \\u2003 i = 1 , 2 (26) d N i , min d t = T s × d C i d t × N C i \\u2003 i = 3 , 4 \\u2009 if \\u2009 N C > 1 8 , \\u2009 or \\u2009 i = 7 , 8 \\u2009 if \\u2009 N C > 1 11 , \\u2009 otherwise , \\u2009 d N i , min d t = − 0.02 (27) d N i , min d t = F lab , min × d C i d t × N C i \\u2003 i = 5 , 6 where N i ,min is the N loss from the i th organic matter pool through mineralization, and all other parameters are the same as in Eqs. (22)–(24) . 3 Model parameterization The study area is located northwest of Phoenix, Arizona, USA, within the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) study area ( Fig. 4 ). The Sonoran Desert scrub biome occupies most of southwestern Arizona below 1050 m ( Turner and Brown, 1994 ). Shreve (1951) recognized seven vegetation subdivisions in the Sonoran Desert, two of which occur in the CAP LTER study area: Lower Colorado River Valley subdivision and Arizona upland subdivision. The lower Colorado River Valley subdivision occupies most of the CAP LTER study area, particularly in the northwestern portion, and is dominated by creosotebush ( Larrea tridentata ) and triangle-leaf bursage ( Ambrosia deltoidea ; Turner and Brown, 1994; MacMahon, 2000 ). The Arizona upland subdivision occurs in the northeastern part of the CAP LTER study area and is dominated by paloverde ( Cercidium microphyllum ) and cacti ( Carnegiea gigantea , Opuntia spp ), with creosotebush and bursage common as well. The rest of the CAP LTER study area is composed mainly of agricultural, urban, and riparian lands. In this study, we focus on the Larrea and Ambrosia co-dominated communities. We have classified input data to PALS-FT into two groups: site-specific parameters and plant-ecophysiological parameters. Site parameters include climatic variables, living and dead plant biomass (initial values of state variables), and soil properties (e.g. texture, organic matter content) ( Table A.1 ). The plant-ecophysiological parameters include distribution of plant root fractions in different soil layers, specific leaf area, respiratory loss ratios of daily production, minimum leaf intercellular CO 2 , contents of N, C, lignin and cellulose in leaves, stems and roots, and production allocation ratios ( Table A.2 ). The two kinds of parameter values were obtained from three sources: the CAP LTER 200-point field survey data, literature, and values used in the original PALS-FT model. The 200-point survey data were the major source for site-specific parameters, although climatic data were obtained from the Wadell Weather Station, which is located in the northwest fringe of metropolitan Phoenix about 50 km from the urban center ( Fig. 4 ). The 200-point survey data were obtained from an extensive field survey with 204 sample plots (30 m × 30 m) throughout the metropolitan area, which was carried out by CAP LTER over a 3-month period in spring 2000 ( Hope et al., 2003 ). In order to obtain a spatially dispersed and unbiased sample that allows for maximum post-design extrapolation, a dual-density randomized tessellation stratified design was used to locate the sample plots. At each location, a systematic, integrated field inventory of key abiotic, biotic, and human variables was carried out. Within each plot all woody plants (trees, shrubs, cacti, succulents) were identified, and the canopy dimensions of each individual measured to give the total volume of woody plant material. Five soil cores were taken at each site, which each were separated into 0–10 cm and 11–30 cm sections. Soil samples were analyzed to determine moisture content, organic matter content, bulk density, particle size distribution, pH, readily leachable soil nitrate and phosphate content, and inorganic and organic C content. Other measured variables included meteorological conditions, land-use and land-cover types, insect populations, surface pollens, and prokaryote and mycorrhizal diversity. In addition, information was also obtained on elevation, distance from urban center, distance from the nearest major freeway, land-use history, median family income, average age of housing stock, and human population density. PALS-FT distinguishes between living and dead biomass. The 200-point survey data only provide total vegetation cover for each plot. In order to estimate the biomass of each of the six plant functional types, we first derived an average vegetation coverage (32.9%) based on the measures in 30 of the 204 plots (see Fig. 4 ), and then calculated the plant cover of individual FTs as the product of the average total cover and the relative cover of each FT which was measured in the same area by Camp (1986) . Then, the total aboveground biomass of each FT was estimated based on empirical cover-biomass relations ( Table 1 ). Further, the biomass of leaves, stems, and roots of perennial FTs (i.e. perennial grass, subshrub and shrub) was calculated using biomass-allocation ratios derived from Chew and Chew (1965) . The dead biomass was calculated according to the dead to living biomass ratio used in the original PALS-FT model. Plant litter is split into metabolic and structural material. We estimated the size of the two litter pools by multiplying the total litter with their respective relative proportions for leaves, stems, and roots as used in the original PALS-FT model. Average SOM was estimated from the field survey data, and its relative organic C content (0.13%) was converted to C (g) per unit area (m 2 ) based on soil bulk density (1.25 g cm −3 ) and rooting depth (100 cm). This resulted in an average soil organic C of 1625 g C m −2 in the Larrea-Ambrosia community ( N = 30 plots). The partitioning of the total soil organic C into the different SOM pools was determined as in the CENTURY model ( Parton et al., 1988; Parton et al., 2001 ). All the above site-specific parameters are listed in Table A.1 . Most of the ecophysiological parameters were determined based on literature and the original PALS-FT model, which was used to analyze the effect of rainfall variability on the hydrologic cycle of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem ( Reynolds et al., 2000 ). The values of these parameters are listed in Table A.2 . 4 Model evaluation Model evaluation usually refers to verification and validation, but may also include model calibration and sensitivity analysis ( Swartzman and Kaluzny, 1987; Rykiel, 1996 ). Model verification is performed to ascertain the correctness of the mathematical formalism and computer code, whereas model validation is the process of evaluating the consistency and accuracy of model behavior against observations ( Jorgensen, 1986 ), or a demonstration that a model, within its domain of applicability, possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model ( Rykiel, 1996 ). Because the overall model structure and belowground components have been tested elsewhere (e.g. Reynolds et al., 1997, 2000; Kemp et al., 2003 ), the emphasis here is to evaluate the accuracy of the PALS-FT prediction of ANPP of a typical Sonoran Desert ecosystem against field observations. We emphasize two validation criteria: 1) the agreement between the simulated and observed ANPP for different FTs and the entire ecosystem, and 2) the agreement between the simulated and known seasonal and inter-annual patterns of ANPP in response to precipitation fluctuations. Because available field observations on NPP of arid or semiarid ecosystems are aboveground NPP, we show only simulated aboveground NPP, although the PASL-FT model simulates belowground NPP as well. 4.1 ANPP at the FT and ecosystem levels To assess the accuracy of predicted ANPP at both the FT and ecosystem levels, we first conducted simulations for an independent test site, a Larrea tridentata -dominated plant community in the San Simon Valley, southeastern Arizona ( Fig. 4 ), where detailed field measurements of ANPP are available. The San Simon Valley site is representative of the widespread Larrea -dominated communities of the Sonoran Desert, and similar to our study site northwest of Phoenix in terms of both community structure and soil properties ( Table 2 ). In a 9.3 ha plot, Chew and Chew (1965) estimated the growth rate of L. tridentata as the addition of new nodes and its productivity as the product of the per-individual growth rate and the number of individuals for different age classes from June, 1958 to August, 1959. The aboveground productivity of other shrubs (e.g. Parthenium incanum ) and grass species was also measured similarly. We ran the model at a daily time step with the initial values of plant biomass for different functional types based on Chew and Chew (1965) ( Table A.3 ) and the actual meteorological data from the San Simon Valley weather station for the same time period that the field measurements were made. Total soil organic C was estimated as 2600 g C m −2 a based on Kenneth's (1980) investigation on the bulk density and SOM content in the San Simon Valley area ( Table 2 ), and was partitioned into different SOM pools as described in Section 2.4 (values listed in Table A.3 ). Other model input parameters, including all ecophysiological parameters, are kept the same as in Table A.2 . The simulated and observed ANPP for the San Simon Valley test site showed reasonable agreement for different FTs and the community as a whole ( Fig. 5 a ). The relative error of the simulated ANPP was ±2.4% for the whole community, and generally less than 25% for different FTs ( Fig. 5 b). Note that we used winter grass here, including perennial grass, forb, and C3 winter annuals, to represent the “fall crop” in Chew and Chew (1965) . For the study area in northwestern Phoenix where direct field measurements of ANPP are not available, we compared the model-predicted results with those in the literature. The simulations were conducted for 15 years using actual daily meteorological data from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 2002. During the 15 years, annual precipitation fluctuated between 61.8 mm (1999) and 516.5 mm (1992) ( Fig. 6 a ). Initial conditions of the Larrea-Ambrosia ecosystem are listed in Tables A.1 and A.2 . The simulated 15-year average ANPP of the ecosystem was 72.3 g m −2 y −1 , ranging from 11.3 to 229.6 g m −2 y −1 ( Fig. 6 a). The simulated mean ANPP was quite close to the observed value (70 g m −2 y −1 ) suggested by Whittaker and Likens (1973) for desert scrub communities (also see Ludwig, 1987 ). The variability in simulated ANPP also is within the range of 10–250 g m −2 y −1 estimated by Lieth (1973) for desert scrub ecosystems and close to that of 30–200 g m −2 y −1 estimated by Noy-Meir (1973) for arid ecosystems. Our modeling results showed that the mean ANPP of the Larrea ecosystem was lower in northwestern Phoenix than in southeastern Arizona. This is consistent with observations. For example, Whittaker and Niering (1975) reported that the ANPP of a Larrea community near Tucson, Arizona was 92.0 g m −2 y −1 , while Chew and Chew's (1965) field measurements showed that the ANPP of the same plant community type, located 140 km away from Tucson, could reach 130 g m −2 y −1 . Furthermore, the simulations showed that 70.9% of the total ecosystem ANPP was contributed by Larrea , 10.9% by subshrub, 3.2% by perennial grasses, 8.1% by C3 annuals, 4.0% by forbs, and 2.9% by C4 annuals. These simulated results were similar to the measurements by Chew and Chew (1965) , which showed that the relative ANPP contributions by different FTs were 69.5% for Larrea , 14.9% for other shrubs, 13.0% for fall crops, and about 1.1% for summer grasses (perennial grasses and forbs were not distinguished in their study). 4.2 Seasonal and inter-annual pattern of NPP in response to precipitation fluctuations Water availability is the primary determinant of primary productivity in arid ecosystems around the world. Can the PALS-FT model accurately simulate the seasonal and inter-annual ANPP dynamics of the Sonoran Desert ecosystem in response to precipitation fluctuations? To address this question, we further analyze the responses of ANPP to precipitation changes based on our simulations at the Phoenix study area from 1988 to 2002. Our simulation results showed that the dynamics of the ecosystem ANPP was closely related to variations in annual precipitation ( R 2 = 0.84; Fig. 6 a). At the FT level, the ANPP of shrub, subshrub, C3 winter annual and forbs also was highly correlated with annual precipitation ( R 2 = 0.80, 0.77, 0.66, and 0.64, respectively; Fig. 6 b). In contrast, the ANPP of C4 summer annuals and perennial grass did not follow the pattern of rainfall ( R 2 = 0.11 and 0.06, respectively; Fig. 6 c). In spite of the general agreement between the two, for a particular year the relationship of ANPP with annual precipitation may not be strong. For example, while the annual precipitation in 2000 and 2001 was quite different (249.25 mm in 2000 versus 161.25 mm in 2001), the simulated ANPP for the two years was quite similar (64.6 g/m 2 in 2000 and 69.3 g/m 2 in 2001). The reason was that the leaf biomass within the ecosystem model decreased dramatically in 2000 because of the drought in 1999 with only 61 mm of rainfall. This phenomenon was also observed in the field ( Bamberg et al., 1976 ). How did the seasonal distribution of rainfall affect ANPP? Did the seasonal pattern of ANPP as predicted by PALS-FT agree with existing knowledge? To address these questions, we portioned annual precipitation into three parts as in Reynolds et al. (2004) ( Fig. 7 ): spring rainfall (April 1–June 31), summer rainfall (July 1–September 31), and winter rainfall (October 1–March 31). Our analysis showed that ANPP of shrub, subshrub, C3 winter annual and forb were most closely related to winter rainfall ( R 2 = 0.68), whereas ANPP of C4 summer annual grass was most closely related to summer rainfall ( R 2 = 0.50). This general pattern was evident by visually comparing Figs. 7 and 8 . In contrast, ANPP of perennial grasses was not strongly correlated with either annual rainfall or rainfall associated with one particular season. Fig. 7 shows that most of the precipitation in the Sonoran Desert falls in winter. This seasonal distribution pattern favors the FTs of shrubs, subshrubs, C3 annuals and forbs whose growth occurs mostly in winter ( Fig. 8 ). However, actual growth responses of C4 grasses may be somewhat different from the modeled responses since the model parameterization for C4 grass that was based on black grama ( Bouteloua eriopoda ), which is not the dominant C4 grass in the northwestern CAP-LTER study area. The C4 grasses of this region could have phenology patterns and growth responses that are substantially different from black grama. 4.3 Comparison of simulated ANPP between PALS-FT and regression models Comparing the predictions by different models for same ecosystem may also provide confidence in the target model. For this reason, we chose two regression models from the literature that have been used to calculate ANPP of desert ecosystem; both developed for North American hot deserts. One is the Turner and Randall's (1989) model, which is a simple regression model that considers only annual precipitation as the determining variable of desert ANPP. The other is the Webb et al. (1983) model, which considers both abiotic factors (annual precipitation, annual potential evapotranspiration) and the current standing crop as primary determinants of Desert ANPP. The Turner and Randall's model has the form: (28) ANPP = 0.30 × ppt − 6.12 where ppt is the annual rainfall in mm. The Webb et al. model has the form: (29) ANPP = 1.8 × FSC × ∑ 1 52 2 T i / 10 × sinh ( 0.1 × max ( 0 , PPT − PET ) × Δ t i ) where FSC is the foliar standing crop (g/m 2 ), T i the weekly average temperature (°C), sin h the hyperbolic sine function, PPT is weekly precipitation (mm), PET is potential evapotranspiration (mm), Δ t i the fraction of a year. FSC was derived from Table A.3 , T i and PPT was calculated from the weather data acquired from the San Simon Valley Weather Station. PET was calculated using the equations provided in Webb et al. (1983) . The results of the regression models are presented in comparison with PALS-FT in Fig. 9 . Both regression models underestimated the Larrea ecosystem ANPP of the San Simon Valley test site by 23.9% and 34.2%, respectively, whereas the PALS-FT model provided an estimate that was closest to the observed ANPP ( Fig. 9 a). Comparing predictions of inter-annual variation in ANPP for the Larrea ecosystem in the CAP LTER study area, the Turner and Randall model prediction is more closely related to annual precipitation than the PALS-FT model prediction ( Fig. 9 b). However, the Turner and Randall model largely underestimates ANPP in wet years (e.g. 1992, 1993) and overestimates ANPP in very dry years (e.g. 1996, 1999; Fig. 9 b). We did not use the Webb's model to simulate the inter-annual ANPP variation because it requires an observed annual FSC value, which was unavailable for the CAP study area. 5 Discussion and conclusions The results of this study showed that the PALS-FT model, although originally developed for the Chihuahuan Desert, was able to simulate ANPP of the Larrea -dominated Sonoran Desert ecosystem reasonably well with only slight modifications. For the independent test site in the San Simon Valley, the relative error of the simulated ANPP was ±2.4% at ecosystem level and generally less than 25% for individual FTs. Parton et al. (1993) claimed that a relative error of ±25% should be acceptable for such simulations. The mean and variability of the simulated NPP for our Phoenix study area were also consistent with observations reported in the literature. Simulated seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of ANPP also seemed reasonable for the Sonoran Desert ecosystem. At the ecosystem level, responses of simulated ANPP to fluctuations in annual precipitation confirmed the well documented general relationship between ANPP and precipitation in arid and semiarid systems, as well as the high variability in productivity with respect to variability in annual rainfall ( LeHouerou et al., 1988 ). Further examination of the relationship for individual FTs revealed the importance of the seasonal distribution of rainfall to ANPP. In particular, winter rainfall was the better predictor of ANPP for most FTs in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem, except for C4 annuals, which are more responsive to summer rainfall. This suggests that, although the decadal pattern of ANPP can be adequately predicted by that of annual precipitation, information on the seasonal distribution of rain is needed for accurate predictions of the ecosystem ANPP for particular years. Reynolds et al. (2004) conducted a comprehensive simulation analysis to explore how plants respond to variations in precipitation and soil water availability in the three North America warm deserts. They concluded that the “pulse-reserve” model, which relates ANPP linearly to annual precipitation ( Noy-Meir, 1973; Turner and Randall, 1989; Whitford, 2002 ), is not adequate. The simulation results of Reynolds et al. (2004) showed that rainfall characteristics (e.g. seasonality and forms of rainfall) and soil water availability were also important to plant growth. In addition to rainfall and soil water availability, several other factors such as N availability, plant age, soil properties, and resource heterogeneity also can play a major role in determining ANPP ( Whitford, 2002 ). Rainfall seasonality is a particularly important driving variable, as it accounts for much of the difference among the North American warm deserts and is likely to be sensitive to CO 2 -induced climate change ( Grimm and Fisher, 1992; Grimm et al., 1997 ). The results of our study further support the notion that rainfall seasonality is crucial to plant growth in the Sonoran Desert. The comparison of predictions of the PALS-FT model with those of two published regression models showed that the PALS-FT model was more accurate in predicting ANPP of the Larrea ecosystem. The underestimation of ANPP by the two regression models was likely due to the exclusion of other important variables that may be influential for predicting ANPP, such as precipitation seasonality and event duration, intensity of storm depth, time lapse since last rainfall, and seasonal temperatures ( Whitford, 2002 ). Regression models have the advantage of fewer parameter requirements, but process-based models such as PALS-FT have more predictive and explanatory power, especially in investigating ecosystem responses to climatic and environmental changes. The PALS-FT model has a structure and includes functional relationships that are similar to some other models that have been employed for analyses in semi-arid grassland ecosystem, such as the CENTURY ( Parton et al., 1988, 1993 ) and GRASS model ( Coughenour et al., 1984 ). The PALS-FT model offers advantages over these models for use in arid shrublands with a diversity of plant FTs, since it has greater detail with respect to soil water dynamics and includes detailed growth and phenology processes of a variety of co-occurring and competing plant functional types that are likely to be found in communities of the hot deserts of southern Arizona. The adaptation and validation of PALS-FT at the local ecosystem level within the Sonoran Desert is a critical, but only first, step toward achieving our long-term goal of understanding how Sonoran Desert ecosystems respond to changes in environmental conditions caused by urbanization and climate change ( Wu and David, 2002 ). Testing model predictions against field observations and other model predictions is only part of the model evaluation process, and a good agreement between simulated and measured values alone does not guarantee the correctness of the model. To further employ the PALS-FT model in the diverse central Arizona Phoenix region, three challenges must be overcome. First, additional FTs (e.g. trees, agricultural crops) that characterize other land-use and land-cover types (e.g. residential urban area, agricultural land, and the upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (see Fig. 4 ) need to be incorporated into the model, or the FTs in the current version of the PALS-FT model need to be modified, reparameterized, and validated. Second, appropriate spatially explicit simulation approaches and scaling methods must be identified and used to link landscape pattern and ecosystem processes at multiple spatial scales (e.g. local ecosystem, landscape, and the whole CAP region), correspondingly, a multilayer spatial database needs to be developed for storing and updating pattern and process information at different scales. Third, variables that show large changes associated with urbanization or climate change- for example, rising temperature, elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and increasing N deposition- must be manipulated in simulation experiments to evaluate their effects. Our results confirm that such simulation experiments are likely to provide a strong and realistic set of predictions with which to compare actual long-term change in this rapidly urbanizing region. Thus, this study provides a basis for further investigating how urbanization-induced environmental changes influence the functional processes of the native Sonoran Desert ecosystem.

       "  'abstract': 'Sigma factor sigma32, encoded by rpoH, is required for the recognition of heat shock genes during normal growth conditions and in response to heat shock and other stresses. Unlike the well-studied Escherichia coli rpoH gene, which is transcribed from four promoters recognized by either a sigma70 (sigmaD)- or sigma24 (sigmaE)-containing RNA polymerase, the Caulobacter crescentus rpoH gene is transcribed from two promoters, P1 and P2. In this study, we have examined the structure and expression of these promoters and shown that the rpoH P2 promoter is sigma32 dependent. We present evidence here that P2 is specifically recognized and transcribed by the reconstituted C. crescentus Esigma32 RNA polymerase holoenzyme. We show that site-directed mutations within either the -10 or the -35 regions of P2 have substantial effects on the levels of transcription by the Esigma32 polymerase predicted from the sigma32 promoter consensus sequence. The mutations have similar effects in vivo as assayed with rpoH-lacZ transcription fusions. Analysis of the rpoH P1 promoter provided evidence that it is sigma70 dependent. S1 nuclease protection assays of rpoH P1- and P2-specific expression after heat shock at 42 or 50 degrees C and during synchronous cell division cycles under normal growth conditions showed that the two promoters are differentially regulated. Mutations within the rpoH P2 promoter consensus sequences abolished the response to heat shock induction in C. crescentus. We conclude from these results that, unlike rpoH genes studied previously in other bacteria, the major transcriptional response of the C. crescentus rpoH gene to heat shock depends on positive autoregulation of the sigma32-dependent promoter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Genetics of methionine content in indica-japonica hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied in 35 F1 hybrids derived from crossing 7 male-sterile indica rice cultivars with 5 restorer japonica rice cultivars. Two genetic models and their corresponding statistical methods for quantitative traits of triploid endosperm in cereal crops were used for the analysis. One is the unconditional model, which refers to the analysis of cumulative measurements along the developmental stages, while another is the conditional model, which relates to analysis throughout the developmental stages. Results showed that methionine content of indica-japonica hybrid rice was controlled by expression of triploid endosperm nuclear genes, cytoplasm genes, diploid maternal plant nuclear genes, and their genotype-environment interaction effects. Dominant effects were important at the first three developmental stages, while additive effects were important at the next two stages of grain development under both unconditional and conditional analyses. With regard to the components of heritability, maternal and cytoplasm general heritabilities and their environmental interaction heritabilities were important. It was suggested that enhancing methionine content could be more efficient when selection is based on maternal plants in early breeding generations. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   China is currently implementing the “separating three property rights” (STPR) reform to consolidate rural land. This reform divides rural land property rights into three components: nontradable ownership, nontradable contractual rights and tradable land use rights. The STPR reform adopts the rental of grassland use rights, a market-oriented approach, as the main arrangement for grassland consolidation. However, this arrangement may undermine the cornerstones of grassland restoration, which are the security of grassland property and payments for ecosystem services (PES) policies. As an alternative to the market-oriented approach, cooperatives are also encouraged to consolidate grassland use rights. We used a natural experiment approach to systematically examine how two different land consolidation arrangements affected key grassland ecosystem services in Inner Mongolia. In rented grasslands, all ecosystem services except provisioning services degenerated severely. Traded grassland use rights were perceived as insecure, which led to predatory land use by tenants. In contrast, cooperative-managed grasslands showed no serious degradation in ecosystem services. However, these cooperatives limited their group size by chief kinship to avoid the free-rider problem; thus, they are unlikely to become a primary channel of grassland consolidation. Because PES policy subsidies are still allocated to grassland contractors rather than to tenants, these policies are irrelevant to the conservation of rented grasslands. Based on our analysis, we suggest several ways to improve this new rural land property reform to avoid a major wave of grassland degradation in China.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During host-virus co-evolution, cells develop innate immune systems to inhibit virus invasion, while viruses employ strategies to suppress immune responses and maintain infection. Here, we reveal that Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging arbovirus causing public concerns and devastating complications, restricts host immune responses through a distinct mechanism. ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) interacts with the host retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), an essential signaling molecule for defending pathogen infections. NS5 subsequently represses K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, attenuates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and inhibits the expression and production of interferon-β (IFN-β), thereby restricting the RIG-I signaling pathway. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the methyltransferase (MTase) domain of NS5 is required for the repression of RIG-I ubiquitination, IRF3 activation, and IFN-β production. Detailed studies further reveal that the conservative active site D146 of NS5 is critical for the suppression of the RIG-I signaling. Therefore, we uncover an essential role of NS5 conservative site D146 in ZIKV-mediated repression of innate immune system, illustrate a distinct mechanism by which ZIKV evades host immune responses, and discover a potential target for anti-viral infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite evidence from experimental grasslands that plant diversity increases biomass production and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, it remains unclear whether this is true in natural ecosystems, especially under climatic variations and human disturbances. Based on field observations from 6,098 forest, shrubland, and grassland sites across China and predictions from an integrative model combining multiple theories, we systematically examined the direct effects of climate, soils, and human impacts on SOC storage versus the indirect effects mediated by species richness (SR), aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), and belowground biomass (BB). We found that favorable climates (high temperature and precipitation) had a consistent negative effect on SOC storage in forests and shrublands, but not in grasslands. Climate favorability, particularly high precipitation, was associated with both higher SR and higher BB, which had consistent positive effects on SOC storage, thus offsetting the direct negative effect of favorable climate on SOC. The indirect effects of climate on SOC storage depended on the relationships of SR with ANPP and BB, which were consistently positive in all biome types. In addition, human disturbance and soil pH had both direct and indirect effects on SOC storage, with the indirect effects mediated by changes in SR, ANPP, and BB. High soil pH had a consistently negative effect on SOC storage. Our findings have important implications for improving global carbon cycling models and ecosystem management: Maintaining high levels of diversity can enhance soil carbon sequestration and help sustain the benefits of plant diversity and productivity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Genetic main effects and genotype x environment (GE) interaction effects for amino acids histidine (His) and arginine (Arg) in milled rice were analyzed by using the genetic models for quantitative traits of triploid endosperm. Nine cytoplasmic male sterile lines as females and five restoring lines as males were included in an incomplete diallel cross in two environments. Results indicated that the His content and Arg content were mainly controlled by genetic main effects, whereas the ratios of His content to protein content (RHP) or Arg content to protein content (RAP) were mainly affected by GE effects. Since genetic variances involved were found significantly for all traits, the genetic controlling of these two amino acids could be simultaneously affected by the endosperm, cytoplasm and maternal genetic effects. For genetic main effects, the cytoplasm and maternal additive effects for these two amino acids possessed high percentage of 60.2-70.9%, which indicated that selection for these amino acids based on maternal performance could be more effective than that based on single seed. The total narrow-sense heritabilities were high for Arg and RAP with 82.4% and 82.3%, and low for His and RHP with 46.4% and 18.2%, respectively. Since general heritabilities for these two amino acids were found to be much larger than GE interaction heritability, the selection advance for these traits could be expected at different environments. Most cytoplasmic and maternal additive correlations were significantly positive and dominance interaction correlations were also important among all the pairwise traits. Indirect selection of these two amino acids applied in rice breeding was discussed.',\n",

The  mutant produced a white-core endosperm compared to the transparent endosperm of the wild type (WT). The results from scanning electron microscope showed that the  mutant grains comprised of round and loosely packed starch granules, some of which were compounded.

Besides, the protein content, the contents of nine different amino acids, and the thermodynamic parameters of   and Δ  in  were also different from those of the WT. Genetic analysis revealed that  mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene. The  gene was mapped between InDel markers R1M30 and ID1-12 on rice chromosome 1. In the candidate region of the Nipponbare genome, an annotated gene, LOC_Os01g44220 which encodes a large subunit of putative ADP-glucose pyrophosphrylase named  was considered the optimal candidate. Cloning and sequencing of LOC_Os01g44220 in different plants of the  mutants revealed a single nucleotide mutation (G→A) in the open reading frame region, which led to a substitution of an acidic amino acid Glu (E) by a basic amino acid Lys (K) accordingly.

It was found that lutein effectively suppressed the secretion of HBsAg from HepG2 2.2.15 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and it also suppressed the amount of extracellular HBV DNA. A luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the effects of lutein on the activities of HBV promoters.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract Biofuels represent an important source of renewable energy and may play a crucial role in developing sustainable energy strategies for many countries and the world as a whole. The pros and cons of biofuels, however, have been debated both scientifically and politically. They remain a topic of controversy. In this paper, the evolvement of the perspectives and policies on biofuels in the United States in the past several decades was reviewed. Four different periods, that is, the period prior to 1978 (marked by the passage of the Energy Act in 1978); 1978–1989 (ending with the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990); 1990–2004 (ending with the passage of the energy act of 2005); and 2005 to the present, which were characterized by defining events of major policy importance were identified. Each time period was assessed using the Ostrom institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework to show the impact of the evolving interests and influences of global players on policy choices related to biofuels in the United States. The US has a long history of supporting corn-based ethanol and more recently advanced biofuels. Changes in perspectives on biofuels from largely unrelated groups led to changes in policy and market dynamics. Until the late 1990s, most perspectives and policies tended to be aligned and significantly supportive of corn-based ethanol in the United States. In the early 2000s, it became clear that the complications associated with first generation biofuels and corn-based ethanol in particular, were too numerous and too severe to overlook. The need for better options has spurred interest in new technologies and more environmentally benign feedstocks, but, there is little prospect for biofuels playing a significant role in the near term without greater alignment among key players.',\n",

The incision of articular capsule was marked for precise wound alignment. In the flexion group, the knee was kept in high flexion for 1 to 2 min after wound closure. The two groups were treated with the same postoperative rehabilitation exercises. The range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS) score of anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS) and postoperative complications were assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, postoperatively.At 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively, the ROM in flexion group was 98.95\\u2009±\\u200910.33° and 110.05\\u2009±\\u20094.93° respectively, with 87.62\\u2009±\\u20098.92° and 95.62\\u2009±\\u20096.51° in extension group, respectively; The VAS score of anterior knee pain in flexion group was 2.02\\u2009±\\u20091.38 and 2.21\\u2009±\\u20090.87, respectively, with 2.57\\u2009±\\u20091.07 and 2.87\\u2009±\\u20090.83 in extension group, respectively.

While there is a universal recognition that sustainability includes social, economic, and environmental components, the relationship and interchangeability between these components has been debated, resulting in three distinct sustainability perspectives: weak, strong, and absurdly strong sustainability. However, despite this active debate, few have questioned which types of sustainability commonly utilized index forms actually measure. Here we provide such an analysis, focusing on the interplay between the mathematical forms of sustainability indices and the three sustainability perspectives. We show that the computational underpinning of a sustainability index defines what type of sustainability the index is capable of measuring, while also providing alternative forms.

       "  'abstract': 'Rice pedicels are tightly associated with the yield of grain. In the present study, a novel and stable pedicel mutant bpb1 (bent pedicel branch 1) was obtained from the wild type \"Zhenong 7\" after 60Co γ-ray treatment. The mutant had the typical phenotype of bent pedicel branches with multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as longer pedicels, short panicles, and dwarfism. Detail examination using scanning electron microscopy revealed that the pedicel epidermal hairs and stomas in the mutant were smaller than those in the wild type. The epidermal and sclerenchymatous cells were arranged irregularly, and the cells in the bend region of pedicels became smaller and arranged closely. The transverse observation of the mutant pedicel branches showed that the small vascular bundles arranged differently from those of the wild type. Genetic analysis indicated that the abnormal phenotypes were controlled by a single recessive gene. Using the F2 mapping population from the bpb1 mutant crossed with the japonica rice variety \"Zhenongda 104\", the bpb1 gene was mapped in a 343 kb region between two SSR markers, RM21537 and RM21552, at the long arm of chromosome 7. Because no homologous gene was found in this region until now, bpb1 might be a novel gene related to the pedicel development and growth. This study could be beneficial to future cloning and functional analysis of the bpb1 gene.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract Biodiversity conservation in urban areas has become increasingly important as cities have expanded to cover larger proportions of landscapes across the world. The careful planning of habitat reserves within urbanized areas has the potential to make significant contributions to regional biodiversity. We surveyed the passerine community in 15 habitat reserves within the Phoenix metropolitan region and explored the relationships between community composition and urban land uses surrounding the reserves. Diversity of different guilds was affected in substantially different ways by reserve characteristics and surrounding urban land use. Guilds responded to land use at all three scales included in the study – 200 m, 1000 m and 2500 m. The responses of four guilds, synanthropic, non-synanthropic, insectivore and feeding generalist, were well predicted by the factors considered here. Reserve characteristics (area, shape, isolation), particularly area, had effects on all four of these guilds with non-synanthropic and insectivore species responding positively to area, while synanthropic and feeding generalist species responded negatively. Land use type surrounding the reserves had significant effects on all of these guilds, except for feeding generalists. High density, high diurnal activity land uses decreased diversity, while medium density, low diurnal activity uses increased the diversity of some guilds, particularly insectivores, probably by providing supplemental habitat. This study provides new evidence from an arid urban landscape that not only reserve characteristics, but also surrounding urban land use should be considered during conservation planning, especially if non-synanthropic or insectivore species are among the targeted species.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cell differentiation and division in Caulobacter crescentus are regulated by a signal transduction pathway mediated by the histidine kinase DivJ and the essential response regulator DivK. Here we report genetic and biochemical evidence that the DivJ and DivK proteins function to control the activity of CtrA, a response regulator required for multiple cell cycle events, including flagellum biosynthesis, DNA replication, and cell division. Temperature-sensitive sokA (suppressor of divK) alleles were isolated as extragenic suppressors of a cold-sensitive divK mutation and mapped to the C terminus of the CtrA protein. The sokA alleles also suppress the lethal phenotype of a divK gene disruption and the cold-sensitive cell division phenotype of divJ mutants. The relationship between these signal transduction components and their target was further defined by demonstrating that the purified DivJ kinase phosphorylates CtrA, as well as DivK. Our studies also showed that phospho-CtrA activates transcription in vitro from the class II flagellar genes and that their promoters are recognized by the principal C. crescentus sigma factor sigma73. We propose that an essential signal transduction pathway mediated by DivJ, DivK, and CtrA coordinates cell cycle and developmental events in C. crescentus by regulating the level of CtrA phosphorylation and transcription from sigma73-dependent class II gene promoters. Our results suggest that an unidentified phosphotransfer protein or kinase (X) is responsible for phosphoryl group transfer to CtrA in the proposed DivJ --> DivK --> X --> CtrA phosphorelay pathway.',\n",

Here, we identify a potential mechanism by which DENV induces tissue injury and vascular leakage by promoting the activation of interleukin (IL)-1β. DENV facilitates IL-1β secretion in infected patients, mice, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and monocyte-differentiated macrophages (THP-1)  activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. The accumulated data suggest that IL-1β probably induces vascular leakage and tissue injury in interferon-alpha/beta receptor 1 deficient C57BL/6 mice (  C57BL/6), whereas IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) alleviates these effects of IL-1β. Finally, administration of recombinant IL-1β protein results in vascular leakage and tissue injury in C57BL/6 mice. Together, the accumulated results demonstrate that IL-1β contributes to DENV-associated pathology and suggest that IL-1RA acts as a potential agent for the treatment of DENV-associated diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'ABSTRACT  Paramyxoviruses include many important animal and human pathogens. The genome of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a prototypical paramyxovirus, encodes a V protein that inhibits viral RNA synthesis. In this work, the mechanism of inhibition was investigated. Using mutational analysis and a minigenome system, we identified regions in the N and C termini of the V protein that inhibit viral RNA synthesis: one at the very N terminus of V and the second at the C terminus of V. Furthermore, we determined that residues L16 and I17 are critical for the inhibitory function of the N-terminal region of the V protein. Both regions interact with the nucleocapsid protein (NP), an essential component of the viral RNA genome complex (RNP). Mutations at L16 and I17 abolished the interaction between NP and the N-terminal domain of V. This suggests that the interaction between NP and the N-terminal domain plays a critical role in V inhibition of viral RNA synthesis by the N-terminal domain. Both the N- and C-terminal regions inhibited viral RNA replication. The C terminus inhibited viral RNA transcription, while the N-terminal domain enhanced viral RNA transcription, suggesting that the two domains affect viral RNA through different mechanisms. Interestingly, V also inhibited the synthesis of the RNA of other paramyxoviruses, such as Nipah virus (NiV), human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3), measles virus (MeV), mumps virus (MuV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This suggests that a common host factor may be involved in the replication of these paramyxoviruses.   IMPORTANCE  We identified two regions of the V protein that interact with NP and determined that one of these regions enhances viral RNA transcription via its interaction with NP. Our data suggest that a common host factor may be involved in the regulation of paramyxovirus replication and could be a target for broad antiviral drug development. Understanding the regulation of paramyxovirus replication will enable the rational design of vaccines and potential antiviral drugs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects approximately 350 million people worldwide, and 600,000 deaths are caused by HBV-related hepatic failure. Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Here, we determine the effect of HBV infection on GP73 production and characterized the role of GP73 in HBV replication. Initially, we show that GP73 is highly produced in the sera of HBV-positive patients with CLDs and in HBV-stimulated leukocytes. Additionally, HBV stimulation promotes GP73 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donors and in macrophages derived from human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1). Notably, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but not HBV replication, is required for the activation of GP73 expression. Moreover, in HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells, GP73 facilitates HBV replication and represses nuclear factor kappa B p50 (NF-κB p50) expression, which in turn represses HBV replication and GP73 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that GP73 facilitates HBV replication by repressing the innate immune response and the NF-κB signalling pathway. Taken together, we revealed a distinct positive feedback mechanism between HBV replication and GP73 production and suggest that GP73 acts as a potential antiviral target for HBV infection.

       "  'abstract': 'It is necessary for rice breeders to understand the genetic basis of nutrient quality traits of rice. Essential amino acids are most important in determining the nutrient quality of rice grain and can affect the health of people who depend on rice as a staple food. In view of the paucity of genetic information available on essential amino acids in indica rice, we estimated the genetic main effects and genotype x environment (G x E) interaction effects on the content of essential amino acids. Nine cytoplasmic male sterile lines as females and five restorer lines as males were introduced in a North Carolina II design across environments. Estimates of the content of the essential amino acids valine, methionine, leucine and phenylalanine showed that they were mainly controlled by genetic main effects, while the contents of threonine, cysteine and isoleucine were mainly affected by G x E effects. In the case of genetic main effects, both cytoplasmic and maternal genetic effects were predominant for all essential amino acids, indicating that selection for improving essential amino acid content based on maternal performance would be more effective than that based on seeds. The total narrow-sense heritabilities were high and ranged from 0.72 to 0.83. Since general heritabilities for these essential amino acids (except for cysteine) were found to be much larger than G x E interaction heritability, the improvement of content of most essential amino acids under selection would be expected under various environments. Rice varieties such as Zhenan 3, Yinchao 1, T49, 26715, 102 and 1391 should be selected as optimal parents for increasing the content of most essential amino acids, while the total genetic effects from Zhexie 2, Xieqingzao, Gangchao 1, V20, Zuo 5 and Zhenshan 97 were mainly negative and these parents could decrease the contents of most essential amino acids.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'RNA interference (RNAi) has been successfully applied in suppression of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. To circumvent the problem that mutation in HBV genome may result in resistance when siRNA is further developed as an anti-viral drug, in this study, we established a dual small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression system, which could simultaneously express two different siRNA molecules that can specifically target two genes. To test the effectiveness of this system, we applied this new approach to express simultaneously two different 21-bp hairpin siRNA duplexes that specifically attack the HBs and HBx genes of HBV, respectively, in Bel-7402 and HepG2.2.15 cells. Results indicated that dual siRNA could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and HBx gene by 83.7% and 87.5%, respectively, based on luciferase assays. In addition, dual siRNA molecules were able to significantly reduce the amount of HBV core associated DNA, which is considered as an intracellular replicative intermediate, and the viral DNA in culture supernatant. Therefore, this dual siRNA system provides a more powerful tool for the study of gene function and implicates a potential application in the treatment of viral infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Salmonella typhi is an important human pathogen responsible for typhoid fever. Type IVB pili, encoded by the S. typhi pil operon located in the major pathogenicity island, are used to facilitate bacterial entry into human intestinal cells in vitro and may be important in the mediation of enteric fever in humans. However, possible involvement of the type IVB pili of S. typhi in signal transduction in infected immune cells has not been examined previously. In this study, we have compared the effect of piliated and nonpiliated S. typhi on the activities of protein kinase C (PKC), the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and nuclear transcription factor NF-κB in human monocytic THP-1 cells. We find that piliated S. typhi can stimulate significantly higher activities of PKC, the production of IL-6 and NF-κB than a nonpiliated strain based on substrate phosphorolysis kinase assay, Western blot, RT-PCR, and luciferase reporter gene assay. In time course experiments, PKC activity increased in a time-dependent fashion after stimulation by the piliated bacteria. The PKC inhibitor Dequalinium chloride (DECA) remarkably reduced the production of IL-6, NF-κB and the activity of PKC induced by the piliated S. typhi. These results suggest that the induction of IL-6 and NF-κB depend on the PKC signal pathway. Our report demonstrates that the type IVB pili of S. typhi play important roles in the production of NF-κB and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, and in the stimulation of PKC activity and therefore, may have effects on the development of fever and other inflammatory responses. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Their calibration models could be introduced to application because of low standard errors of prediction for both methods (0.007%) and high coefficients of determination (87.1% and 87.4%, respectively). Furthermore, the prediction ability of the equation based on the brown rice spectroscopy could be still used for determination application though their effects were worse than that of the milled rice flour spectroscopy. It was concluded that the equation could be directly used to estimate the content of tryptophan in milled rice, and the technology of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy developed in this study could be applied in selecting breeding materials for higher tryptophan content and in quality control during rice processing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains have been considered to be attractive as potential live oral delivery vector vaccines because of their ability to elicit the full array of immune responses in humans. In this study, we constructed an attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi strain stably expressing conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by integrating the N gene into the pilV gene, which was under the control of the type IVB pilus operon promoter in S. enterica serovar Typhi. BALB/c mice were immunized with this recombinant strain through different routes: intranasally, orogastrically, intraperitoneally, and intravenously. Results showed that the intranasal route caused the highest production of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG2a, and secretory IgA, where IgG2a was imprinted as a Th1 cell bias. Moreover, this recombinant live vaccine induced significantly high levels of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activities and increased gamma interferon-producing T cells compared with the parental strain. Our work provides insights into how the type IVB pilus operon promoter controlling SARS-CoV N gene expression in Salmonella might be attractive for a live-vector vaccine against SRAS-CoV infection, for it could induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses. Our work also indicates that the type IVB pilus operon promoter controlling foreign gene expression in Salmonella can elicit full immune responses by intranasal vaccination.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The phytohormone auxin plays critical roles in regulating myriads of plant growth and developmental processes. Microbe infection can disturb auxin signaling resulting in defects in these processes, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Auxin signaling begins with perception of auxin by a transient co-receptor complex consisting of an F-box transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) protein and an auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) protein. Auxin binding to the co-receptor triggers ubiquitination and 26S proteasome degradation of the Aux/IAA proteins, leading to subsequent events, including expression of auxin-responsive genes. Here we report that Rice dwarf virus (RDV), a devastating pathogen of rice, causes disease symptoms including dwarfing, increased tiller number and short crown roots in infected rice as a result of reduced sensitivity to auxin signaling. The RDV capsid protein P2 binds OsIAA10, blocking the interaction between OsIAA10 and OsTIR1 and inhibiting 26S proteasome-mediated OsIAA10 degradation. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing wild-type or a dominant-negative (degradation-resistant) mutant of OsIAA10 phenocopy RDV symptoms are more susceptible to RDV infection; however, knockdown of OsIAA10 enhances the resistance of rice to RDV infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of viral protein reprogramming of a key step in auxin signaling initiation that enhances viral infection and pathogenesis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection causes hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), meningoencephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and even fatal encephalitis in children, thereby presenting a serious risk to public health. It is important to determine the mechanisms underlying the regulation of EV71 infection. In this study, we initially show that the interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (ILF2) reduces EV71 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) and attenuates EV71 plaque-formation unit (PFU), thereby repressing EV71 infection. Microarray data analyses show that ILF2 mRNA is reduced upon EV71 infection. Cellular studies indicate that EV71 infection represses ILF2 mRNA expression and protein production in human leukemic monocytes (THP-1) -differentiated macrophages and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. In addition, EV71 nonstructural protein 2B interacts with ILF2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. Interestingly, in the presence of EV71 2B, ILF2 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and it colocalizes with 2B in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we present a distinct mechanism by which EV71 antagonizes ILF2-mediated antiviral effects by inhibiting ILF2 expression and promoting ILF2 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through its 2B protein.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Interleukin (IL)-27 is a new member of the IL-6/IL-12 family, composed of two subunits, the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) and p28 chains (p28), and produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells. IL-27 plays an important role in the regulation of differentiation of naive T helper cells and has diverse effects on innate immune cells. However, the pro-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-27 are still not well known. In this study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the production of IL-27. We found that LPS-stimulated IL-27 production was in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in THP-1 cells. We have also shown that IL-27 induced PGE2 production and COX-2 gene expression at the level of mRNA as well as protein. Moreover, we found feed back effect of PGE2 on the production of IL-27 in THP-1 cells. The results suggest that PGE2 significantly inhibits LPS-induced IL-27 production, without affecting basal IL-27 expression. Further experiment suggests that PGE2 and LPS regulate IL-27 through NF-κB pathway. Our findings may have wide implication for IL-27 in inflammatory diseases. © 2010 The Authors.

       "  'abstract': 'Viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) are a cluster of viral proteins that have evolved to counteract eukaryotic antiviral RNA silencing pathways, thereby contributing to viral pathogenicity. In this study, we revealed that the matrix protein P4 encoded by Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV), which is an emerging cytoplasmic rhabdovirus, is a weak RNA silencing suppressor. By conducting yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and subcellular co-localization assays, we proved that P4 interacts with the rice endogenous suppressor of gene silencing 3 (OsSGS3). We also determined that P4 overexpression has no effect on OsSGS3 transcription. However, P4 can promote the degradation of OsSGS3 via ubiquitination and autophagy. Additionally, a Potato virus X-based expression system was used to confirm that P4 enhances the development of mosaic symptoms on Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by promoting hydrogen peroxide accumulation, but not cell death. To verify whether P4 is a pathogenicity factor in host plants, we generated transgenic P4-overexpressing rice plants, which exhibited disease-related developmental defects, including decreased plant height and excessive tillering. Our data suggest that RSMV-encoded P4 serves as a weak VSR that inhibits antiviral RNA silencing by targeting OsSGS3.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Experiments were conducted on rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) using a diallel design with nine parents: Youcai 601, Double 20-4, Huashuang 3, Gaoyou 605, Zhongyou 821, Eyouchangjia, Zhong R-888, Tower and Zheshuang 72. The seed developmental process was divided into five stages, namely initial (days 1-15 after flowering), early (days 16-22 after flowering), middle (days 23-29), late (days 30-36), and maturing (days 37-43) developmental stages. The variation of dynamic genetic effects for leucine and isoleucine contents of rapeseed meal was analysed at five developmental stages, across different environments using the genetic models with time-dependent measures. The results from unconditional and conditional analyses indicated that the expression of diploid embryo, cytoplasmic and diploid maternal plant genes were important for leucine and isoleucine contents at different developmental stages of rapeseed, particularly at the initial and early developmental stages. Among different genetic systems, nutrition quality traits were mainly controlled by the accumulative or net maternal main effects and their GE interaction effects, except at maturity when the net diploid embryo effects were larger. The expression of genes was affected by the environmental conditions on 15, 22, 29 or 36 days after flowering, but was more stable at mature stage. For the isoleucine content the narrow-sense heritabilities on 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 days after flowering were 43.0, 65.7, 60.1, 65.5 and 78.2%, respectively, while for the leucine content the corresponding narrow-sense heritabilities were relatively smaller. The interaction heritabilities were more important than the general heritabilities at the first three developmental times. The improvement for isoleucine content could be achieved by selection based on the higher narrow-sense heritabilities. Various genetic systems exhibited genetic correlations among the developmental times or leucine and isoleucine contents. A simultaneous improvement of leucine and isoleucine contents seems possible because of the significant positive genetic correlation components from different genetic systems at different developmental times.',\n",

Animal models are needed to investigate the causes of outbreaks and to understand the pathogenesis of mumps virus (MuV). In this study, we have examined the infection of three animal models with an isolate of mumps virus from a recent outbreak (MuV-IA). We have found that while both ferrets and mice generated humoral and cellular immune responses to MuV-IA infection, no obvious signs of illness were observed in these animals; rhesus macaques were the most susceptible to MuV-IA infection. Infection of rhesus macaques via both intranasal and intratracheal routes with MuV-IA led to the typical clinical signs of mumps 2 weeks to 4 weeks postinfection. However, none of the infected macaques showed any fever or neurologic signs during the experimental period. Mumps viral antigen was detected in parotid glands by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

       "  'abstract': 'The complexity of social-ecological systems (SES) is rooted in the outcomes of node activities connected by network topology. Thus far, in network dynamics research, the connectivity degree (CND), indicating how many nodes are connected to a given node, has been the dominant concept. However, connectivity focuses only on network topology, neglecting the crucial relation to node activities, and thereby leaving system outcomes largely unexplained. Inspired by the phenomenon of “consensus of wills and coordination of activities” often observed in disaster risk management, we propose a new concept of network characteristic, the consilience degree (CSD), aiming to measure the way in which network topology and node activities together contribute to system outcomes. The CSD captures the fact that nodes may assume different states that make their activities more or less compatible. Connecting two nodes with in/compatible states will lead to outcomes that are un/desirable from the perspective of the SES in question. We mathematically prove that the CSD is a generalized CND, and the CND is a special case of CSD. As a general, fundamental concept, the CSD can facilitate the development of a new framework of network properties, models, and theories that allows us to understand patterns of network behavior that cannot be explained in terms of connectivity alone. We further demonstrate that a co-evolutionary mechanism can naturally improve the CSD. Given the generality of co-evolution in SES, we argue that the CSD is an inherent attribute rather than an artificial concept, which underpins the fundamental importance of the CSD to the study of SES.',\n",

However, the impacts of these land surface modifications on climate are yet to be adequately understood. Using a coupled process-based land-atmospheric model, therefore, we quantified the climatic effects of land cover and land management changes over mainland China from 2001 to 2010, via incorporation of real-time and high-quality satellite-derived landscape representation (i.e., vegetation fraction, leaf area index, and albedo) into numerical modeling. Our results show that differences in landscape patterns due to changes in land cover and land management have exerted a strong influence on summer climate in China. During 2001 and 2010, extensive cooling of up to 1.5°C was found in the Loess Plateau and 1.0°C in northeastern China. In contrast, regional-scale warming was detected in the Tibetan Plateau (0.3°C), Yunnan province (0.4°C), and rapidly expanding urban centers across China (as high as 2°C). Summer precipitation decreased in the northeastern region, with patchy reduction generally <1.8mm/day, but increased in the Loess Plateau, with local spikes up to 2.4mm/day. Our study highlights that human alterations of landscapes have had substantial impacts on summer climate over the entire mainland China, but these impacts varied greatly on the regional scale, including changes in opposite directions. Therefore, effective national-level policies and regional land management strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation should take explicit account of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape-climate interactions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rice stripe virus (RSV) is the type species of the genus Tenuivirus and represents a major viral pathogen affecting rice production in East Asia. In this study, RSV p2 was fused to yellow fluorescent protein (p2-YFP) and expressed in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. p2-YFP fluorescence was found to move to the nucleolus initially, but to leave the nucleolus for the cytoplasm forming numerous distinct bright spots there at later time points. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay showed that p2 interacted with fibrillarin and that the interaction occurred in the nucleus. Both the nucleolar localization and cytoplasmic distribution of p2-YFP fluorescence were affected in fibrillarin-silenced N.\\u2009benthamiana. Fibrillarin depletion abolished the systemic movement of RSV, but not that of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Potato virus X (PVX). A Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method was used to diminish RSV\\u2005NS2 (encoding p2) or NS3 (encoding p3) during RSV infection. Silencing of NS3 alleviated symptom severity and reduced RSV accumulation, but had no obvious effects on virus movement and the timing of symptom development. However, silencing of NS2 abolished the systemic movement of RSV. The possibility that RSV p2 may recruit or manipulate nucleolar functions to promote virus systemic infection is discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The dynamic expression of genes for oil and protein contents of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) was carried out with time-dependent measures by using the developmental genetic models for quantitative traits in diploid plant. The unconditional and conditional analysis showed that the accumulated genetic effects or net genetic effects from diploid embryo nuclear genes, cytoplasmic genes and diploid maternal plant nuclear genes were all important for the performance of both nutrient quality traits at most developmental times/stages. Results from the conditional analysis further revealed that the activation of quantitative genes was gradually carried through the developmental process with maternal genes playing more active role at most developmental stages. Additive effects from embryo and maternal plant were found more important than the dominant effects at most developmental times/stages for both traits, and especially for protein content of rapeseed. Heritability analysis confirmed that the maternal heritability for protein contents were considerably stronger throughout developmental period except for the developmental time at 22 days, while for oil content the heritability components were dynamic and time dependent. The differences of genetic relationships from various genetic systems were found for oil and protein contents among the developmental times or between the two quality traits. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.',\n",

Methods:  The whole herb of BP was extracted with 95 % ethanol, which was then partitioned\\xa0sequentially with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butyl alcohol to obtain petroleum ether, ethyl\\xa0acetate (EE-BP), n-BuOH and water fractions. EE-BP was further isolated and purified by repeated\\xa0column chromatography. The obtained compounds were identified by comparing 1H and 13C nuclear\\xa0magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra with published data for the compounds.

To evaluate the mechanisms behind this event, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in the regulation of IL-6. Results showed that the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein activated IL-6 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Promoter analyses suggested that NF-kappaB binding element was required for IL-6 expression regulated by N protein. Further studies demonstrated that N protein bound directly to NF-kappaB element on the promoter. We also showed that N protein activated IL-6 expression through NF-kappaB by facilitating the translocation of NF-kappaB from cytosol to nucleus. Mutational analyses revealed that two regions of N protein were essential for its function in the activation of IL-6. These results provided new insights into understanding the mechanism involved in the function of SARS-CoV N protein and pathogenesis of the virus.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human population growth and urbanization are two dominant demographic trends in our time (Brown, 2001). World population has\\n continued to grow exponentially for the past several decades, and reached 6.2 billion in 2002, with a current annual increase\\n rate of almost 80 million (Earth Policy Institute, 2002). The proportion of the total world population that is urban was only\\n a few percent in the 1800s, but it increased to 14% by 1900, rapidly jumped to about 30% in 1950 (Platt, 1994a; Wu and Overton,\\n 2002), and is passing 50% now. Evidently, as the world’s human population has increased exponentially, so has the proportion\\n of people living in cities (Fig. 2.1). It has been projected that 60% of the world’s population will reside in urban areas\\n by 2025 (Platt, 1994a). In 1800, there was only one city, Beijing, in the entire world that had more than a million people;\\n 326 such cities existed 200 years later (Brown, 2001). The urban population is growing three times faster than the rural population\\n (Nilsson et al., 1999), and we are now witnessing a historically unprecedented and monumental, global-scale, rural-to-urban\\n transition. To quote Lester Brown (2001), “For the first time, we will be an urban species!”\\n \\n At a more regional scale, urban people already account for more than two thirds of the European population today. In the United\\n States, 74% of the population resided in urban areas in 1989, and this number will increase to more than 80% by 2025 (Pickett\\n et al., 2001). The historical record so far has shown that both the number of mega-cities as well as the number of urban dwellers\\n have increased much faster in developing countries than in developed countries. For example, nearly 40% of the population\\n of the Asia-Pacific region is now urban, and the region contains 13 of the 25 largest cities of the world. It has been estimated\\n that by 2015 about 903 million people in Asia will live in cities with a population of over one million people (cf. Wu and\\n Overton, 2002). While the world’s urban population is projected to rise to 60% by 2025, nearly half of these people will reside\\n in the Asia-Pacific region. Undoubtedly, urbanization will continue to have significant impact on the environment as well\\n as on economic, social, and political processes at local, regional, and global scales.\\n \\n \\n ',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Exploring the regulatory mechanism played by endogenous rice miRNAs in defense responses against the blast disease is of great significance in both resistant variety breeding and disease control management. We identified rice defense-related miRNAs by comparing rice miRNA expression patterns before and after Magnaporthe oryzae strain Guy11 infection. We discovered that osa-miR164a expression reduced upon Guy11 infection at both early and late stages, which was perfectly associated with the induced expression of its target gene, OsNAC60. OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes. By using transgenic rice over-expressing osa-miR164a, and a transposon insertion mutant of OsNAC60, we showed that when the miR164a/OsNAC60 regulatory module was dysfunctional, rice developed significant susceptibility to Guy11 infection. The co-expression of OsNAC60 and osa-miR164a abolished the OsNAC60 activity, but not its synonymous mutant. We further validated that this regulatory module is conserved in plant resistance to multiple plant diseases such as the rice sheath blight, tomato late blight, and soybean root and stem rot diseases. Our results demonstrate that the miR164a/OsNAC60 regulatory module manipulates rice defense responses to M. oryzae infection. This discovery is of great potential for resistant variety breeding and disease control to a broad spectrum of pathogens in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

       "  'abstract': 'A protocol for rapid and efficient plant regeneration from protoplasts of red cabbage was developed by a novel nurse culture method. When the protoplasts of red cabbage were cultured in modified MS medium containing various combinations of BA, NAA and 2,4-D, they did not continue dividing due to browning. However, they successfully divided and formed micro-calli at a high efficiency when they were mixed and co-cultured with those of tuber mustard at a 1:1 ratio. The presence of tuber mustard protoplasts used as nurse cells was essential for sustainable divisions and colony formation of red cabbage protoplasts. Red cabbage-like plantlets were regenerated from these protoplast-derived calli at a frequency ranging from 33 to 56% in all the experiments where three cultivars of red cabbage were tested. Over 120 protoplast-derived cabbage plants were transferred to the greenhouse, and they showed no noticeable abnormalities in morphological features. Chromosome observation revealed that all of the plants examined had the normal chromosome number of cabbage (2n = 18), suggesting that no spontaneous fusion between the two species had occurred during protoplast culture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Urbanization effects on ecosystem functions are both important and complex, characterized by scale multiplicity, spatial heterogeneity, and intensive human disturbances. Integrating the hierarchical structure of urban landscape pattern with ecosystem processes through simulation modeling can facilitate our understanding of human-environment interactions in urban environment. Current ecosystem models often focus on plant physiological and biogeochemical processes in homogeneous land covers, incapable of addressing the structural complexity in urban landscapes with multiple anthropogenic drivers across a range of spatial scales. Here we present the Hierarchical Patch Mosaic-Urban Ecosystem Model (HPM-UEM), a multi-scaled model that explicitly treats spatial pattern and hierarchical structure of urban landscape by incorporating both top-down controls and bottom-up mechanisms in urban environment. By addressing six hierarchical levels from individual plant to the urbanized region, HPM-UEM provides a \" hierarchical ladder\" to scale up local ecosystem functions across the nested urban land hierarchies (i.e., land cover, land use, landscape, and the urbanized region), and facilitate linking ecosystem processes and socioeconomic drivers. By organizing human influences in a spatially nested hierarchical patch mosaic structure, HPM-UEM models the complex spatiotemporal pattern of multiple environmental constraints on urban ecosystem functions. The model was evaluated based on extensive datasets developed by the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, especially the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) LTER. Model testing results showed that HPM-UEM predicted both C fluxes and spatial pattern of C stocks with reasonable accuracy. HPM-UEM enabled us to assess spatial patterns and multiple-scaled dynamics of C cycle of the urban landscape, revealing the distinct productivities and C densities of different urban land types across different spatial scales. Sensitivity analyses indicated that future environmental changes and landscape modifications could have strong and complex effects on urban ecosystem functions. By matching ecological processes, anthropogenic environmental controls, and land and socioeconomic dynamics based on hierarchical levels, HPM-UEM could be coupled to multiple-scaled urban land-use models, climate models, and socioeconomic models to gain a comprehensive understanding of urban biogeochemical cycles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The neuraminidase (NA) gene of Gs/Gd/1/96 had the highest genetic similarity with A/Duck/Hokkaido/55/96 (H1N1-55) virus. The haemagglutinin (HA) gene of Gs/Gd/1/96 virus might have originated as a result of mutation of H5 HA gene from A/Swan/Hokkaido/51/96 (H5N3-51)-like viruses. The PA gene of H5N3-51 virus had the highest similarity with Gs/Gd/1/96. This study explains the origin of first Asian HPAI H5N1 virus in Guangdong by the reassortment of Nanchang (close to Guangdong) and Hokkaido (Japan) (H1N1-55 and H5N3-51) viruses.

A distinctive aspect of flagellum biosynthesis is the periodic expression of the flagellar genes during the cell cycle in a sequence corresponding to the order of gene product assembly into the growing flagellum. This program of gene expression is achieved in part by the organization of flagellar genes into a four-tiered regulatory hierarchy that controls their expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Because of the close interconnection of the developmental program to the asymmetric cell-division cycle in C. crescentus, studies of flagellar gene regulation and motility have also begun to reveal basic mechanisms responsible for control of the cell cycle itself. Here, we review recent work on regulation of the flagellar gene hierarchy in C. crescentus and consider regulatory mechanisms that are distinct from those described in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lateral flows in landscape mosaics represent a fundamentally important process in landscape ecology, but are still poorly\\n understood in general. For example, windblown litter nutrient transfer across a landscape has rarely been studied from an\\n ecosystem perspective. In this study we measured the litter nutrient transfer from an Acacia mangium plantation to a Dimocarpus longan orchard in an agroforestry landscape for 3\\xa0years from January 2002 to December 2004. About 11% of the total litterfall of\\n the acacia plantation were transported to the longan orchard annually, accounting for ca. 9–59% of the total litter nutrient\\n input of the longan orchard. The windblown litter transfer showed high spatial variation mainly caused by wind speed and directions.\\n Slope positions 5\\xa0m away from the source acacia plantation received significantly greater amount of allochthonous acacia litter\\n than those 10\\xa0m away, and the northwest-facing slope of the longan orchard received 2 to 3-fold more litter than the southeast-\\n and south-facing slopes because of the prevailing southeasterly wind in the region. To explore how different management practices\\n may influence the litterfall, leaf production, and soil nutrient status of the two ecosystems, we developed a Meta-Ecosystem\\n Litter Transfer (MELT) model to simulate the processes of litter-related transformation (production, deposition, and decomposition)\\n and transfer (wind- and management-driven movement). Our simulation results suggest that less than 30% of acacia litter should\\n be transferred to the longan orchard in order for the acacia plantation to sustain itself and maximize production of the longan.\\n Connectivity of nutrient flow between adjacent ecosystems as shown here leads to a functional meta-ecosystem with higher landscape-scale\\n production of ecosystem services. That is, managing this connectivity through landscape design or active litter transfers\\n can lead to large changes in overall landscape functioning and service production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SummaryThe rapid loss of global biodiversity can greatly affect the functioning of above-ground components of ecosystems. However, how such biodiversity losses affect below-ground communities and linkages to soil carbon (C) sequestration is unclear. Here, we describe how losses in plant functional groups (PFGs) affect soil microbial and nematode communities and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a 4-year removal experiment conducted on the Mongolian plateau, the worldu0027s largest remaining natural grassland.Our results demonstrated that the biomasses or abundances of most components of the two below-ground communities (microbes and nematodes) were negatively affected by PFG loss and were positively related to above-ground plant biomass. The removal of dominant PFGs (perennial bunchgrasses and perennial rhizomatous grasses) reduced the biomass or abundance of below-ground community components while removal of less dominant PFGs (perennial forbs and annuals/biennials) did not change or increased the biomass or abundance of below-ground community components.The biomass-based ratio of fungal to bacterial microbes and the number-based ratio of fungal-feeding to bacterial-feeding nematodes decreased with increasing PFG losses. Variation partitioning analyses showed that the identity of PFGs together with above-ground plant biomass explained most of the total variation in soil microbes and that the identity of PFGs and above-ground plant biomass together with nematode food resources explained most of the total variation in soil nematodes. The increase in NEE with PFG loss was mainly explained by decreases in above-ground plant biomass and the ratio of fungi to bacteria.Synthesis. The shift of below-ground communities from a fungal-based to a bacterial-based energy channel as PFG richness decreases indicates that less diverse grassland ecosystems will have lower nutrient retention and hence be more sensitive to land-use or climate change. The dominant effects of above-ground plant biomass and below-ground communities on NEE indicate that PFG loss resulting from land-use or climate change has the potential to reduce C sequestration in semi-arid grassland soils. These findings suggest that predictive models may need to consider the composition of above-ground and below-ground communities in order to accurately simulate the dynamics of CO2 fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Summary 1. Understanding the productivity-diversity relationship (PDR) is a key issue in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research, and has important implications for ecosystem management. Most studies have supported the predominance of a hump- shaped form of PDR in which species richness peaks at an intermediate level of productivity. However, this view has been challenged recently on several grounds. 2. Based on data from 854 field sites across the Inner Mongolia region of the Eurasian Steppe, we tested the form of PDR at different organizational levels (association type, vegetation type and biome) and multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and regional). 3. Our results showed that a positive linear, rather than hump-shaped, form was ubiquitous across all organizational levels and spatial scales examined. On the regional scale, this monotonic PDR pattern corresponded closely with the gradient in mean annual precipitation (MAP) and soil nitrogen. Increasing species dissimilarity with productivity could also contribute to the positive linear form of PDR. 4. Our results also indicated that grazing decreased both primary productivity and species richness but, intriguingly, not the form of PDR. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first direct test of the productivity- diversity relationship for the world's largest contiguous terrestrial biome - the Eurasian Steppe. The predominance of a positive linear relationship in this region defies the commonly held view that a unimodal form of PDR dominates terrestrial ecosystems, supported mainly by studies in Africa, Europe and North America. It suggests that precipitation has a greater control on the productivity-diversity relationship in the Eurasian Steppe than grasslands elsewhere. Also, the positive linear relationship is surprisingly robust to grazing. Our results provide new insight into the productivity- diversity relationship and have several implications for restoring degraded lands and understanding ecological consequences of climate change in the Eurasian Steppe.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Apart from transepicondylar axis, the native femoral sulcus was also reported to be used as a guide for the femoral component position in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, it was not shown in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis. This study was conducted to compare the position of trochlear groove in patients with and without osteoarthritis, and to assess whether trochlear groove could be used as a guide for position of femoral component in TKA for severe knee osteoarthritis.Total 50 severe knee osteoarthritis patients (Kellgren Lawrence grade 3 or 4) who underwent TKA were included. Meanwhile, 50 patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery without osteoarthritis were included as control. The distance from trochlear groove to the midpoint of a virtual anterior condyle osteotomy line (parallel to the posterior condyle line) (a-b) was recorded by radiological and surgical measurements. Midpoint of transepicondylar axis and trochlear groove were used as guide for placing prosthesis model in TKA, respectively. No-thumb test was performed to assess the patellar tracking. The position of femoral component was finally performed using trochlear groove as guide in TKA.Value of \"a-b\" was significantly different between osteoarthritic and control knees (P\\u2009=\\u20090.008). During the placement of prosthesis model, similar patellar tracking was detected between using midpoint of transepicondylar axis and trochlear groove as guide (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). After placing femoral component using trochlear groove as guide, most patients obtained good patellofemoral congruence with pneumatic tourniquet inflated (n\\u2009=\\u200943) or deflated (n\\u2009=\\u20095), and good patellofemoral congruence was also obtained by lateral patellar retinaculum release in two patients.Despite the shifting of trochlear groove caused by severe knee osteoarthritis, trochlear groove can be used as a guide for position of femoral component, with equivalent patellar tracking compared with transepicondylar axis.',\n",

Firstly, Colour Deconvolution is used to conduct staining separation on a Hu0026E-stained immunohistochemical image, and then blood vessels are segmented using an improved Otsu algorithm. Then the standard SURF algorithm is used to select feature points of the image, and then these feature points are divided into two equal groups according to the distance between individual feature points and the far left (or right) feature point. Finally, a standard least squares method is used to fit two lines using the two groups of points. When the linear deviation of the fitting result based on the two groups of feature points is significant, it is necessary to adjust the belonging of the points of the two groups, and then the two sets are fitted again respectively till the correlation coefficients of the two fitted lines are greater than the predefined threshold, meaning that the measurement of the blood vessel angle in the immunohistochemical map is completed. Compared with the experts’ results, our proposed technique results in better accuracy. It is worthy to point out that, to our knowledge, our system is the first one that conducts automated measurement of blood vessel angle of immunohistochemistry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The sequential transcription of flagellar (fla) genes in the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle is controlled by the organization of these genes in a regulatory hierarchy of four levels (I-IV). Level III and level IV genes at the bottom of the hierarchy are dependent on level II genes and are transcribed late in the cell cycle from sigma 54-dependent promoters. To study the regulation of genes at levels III and IV, we have isolated and sequenced the rpoN gene in order to analyze its expression, purified the rpoN gene product, and examined the role of the RpoN protein in initiation of transcription from sigma 54-dependent promoters. We report here epistasis experiments that show rpoN is required for transcription of level III genes, but that the expression of the rpoN gene itself is not dependent on any of the fla genes examined; these results place rpoN at level II near the top of the hierarchy. Consistent with this conclusion were nuclease S1 assays that mapped the rpoN transcription start site and identified a sequence centered at -24, GTTA/TACCA/TT, which is similar to the core consensus sequence of the level IIB fliF, fliL, and fliQ promoters. We purified the full-length rpoN gene product to near homogeneity and demonstrated that the RpoN protein is required for transcription from the well-characterized sigma 54-dependent glnAp2 promoter of Escherichia coli and specifically recognizes the level III flbG gene promoter of C. crescentus. These last results confirm that rpoN encodes the C. crescentus sigma 54 factor and opens the way for the biochemical analysis of transcriptional regulation of level III and IV fla genes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There are wide ranges of lutein and β-carotene in Chinese kale. This work assessed the capability of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict the contents of lutein and β-carotene in Chinese kale against HPLC analysis. Compared to other regression methods, the regression of modified partial least squares with math treatments of 2,4,4,1 (where the first number of 2 represents the second derivative of log 1/ R , the second of 4 is the gap in data points over which the derivative is calculated, the third and fourth numbers refer to the number of data points used in the first and second smoothing, respectively) showed the best results. The calibration equations of lutein and β-carotene were characterized by the coefficients of determination (RSQ) of 0.983 and 0.982 and standard error of 0.056 and 0.131 mg g −1 DW, respectively. In cross-validation, high 1 minus variance ratio (1 − VR) of 0.955 and 0.966 and standard error of 0.092 and 0.179 mg g −1 DW for lutein and β-carotene were obtained, respectively. In external validations, the RSQ were 0.926 and 0.875 with standard error of 0.131 and 0.367 mg g −1 DW, respectively. These results showed that NIRS could be used for the determination of carotenoids in Chinese kale.

Both lutein and β-carotene ( Fig. 1 ), well-known carotenoids, are widely present in vegetables and fruits: the former is the most important precursors of provitamin A; the latter can increase macular pigment concentration in eyes and may improve visual function ( Krinsky, 2001 ). Recent research has demonstrated that lutein and β-carotene can act as powerful antioxidants and to help guard against aging, cancers and diseases ( http://www.luteininfo.com ( Anon, 2008c ); http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-betacarotene.html ( Anon, 2008a )). It is very important for nutritionists and researchers to obtain the information on lutein and β-carotene content in vegetables and fruits. The common methods for determining of lutein and β-carotene, based on solvent extraction followed by HPLC analysis, usually involve high cost, labor and time input, and specialized technicians. In addition, the volatile, degradable or hazardous chemicals used in the extraction and HPLC analysis can imply some instability of results and health risk on human health and environment. To date, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), widely used as a fast, accurate and non-pollution method for qualitative and quantitative analysis in food and pharmaceutical fields for the last 30 years ( Cen and He, 2007; Roggo et al., 2007 ), have been well recommended for the determination of total carotenoids in carrot fruit ( Schulz et al., 1998 ) and wheat seeds ( Atienza et al., 2005 ) and especially some individual carotenoids such as lycopene and lutein in tomato products ( Pedro and Ferreira, 2005 ), zeaxanthin and lutein in maize seeds ( Brenna and Berardo, 2004; Berardo et al., 2004 ); however, there is very limited correlative research in the non-seed plant tissues. Recently, our research group has succeeded in determining seed traits of crops by NIRS ( Wu et al., 2002, 2006; Wu and Shi, 2003, 2004, 2007; Lin et al., 2005 ). The purpose of this work was to test the potential of NIRS for simultaneously predicting the lutein and β-carotene contents in the non-seed tissues of Chinese kale and to provide a simple, rapid and accurate analysis method via NIRS technique. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Samples Chinese kale varieties with high variation of agronomy traits were planted under different seasons, soil types and fertilizer conditions in Zhejiang province over a period of 2 years (2004–2005). Edible tender and succulent plant parts comprising one or several stout and chunky stems accompanied with small and loose terminal floral buds, ∼6–7 pieces of flat and broad leaves, and ∼2–3 lateral branches were separately or mix harvested at the very beginning of flowering, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. After being lyophilized by a freeze dryer (Vir Tis, USA), ground into powder by a WK-200B miller (Dongwan, China) and filtrated with 0.25 mm screen, the total freeze-dried powder of 151 samples was stored in a desiccator at −20 °C prior to HPLC and NIRS analysis. 2.2 Extraction of lutein and β-carotene The extraction of lutein and β-carotene were conducted according to the protocol of Gilmore and Yamamoto (1991) with modifications. About 0.1 g freeze-dried powder was weighed into 10 ml tubes and extracted with 4 ml of acetone for 30 min in an ultrasonic cleaning bath (SK5200H, Kudos, China) operating at 59 kHz frequency. The supernatants were decanted and stored on ice, and the pellets were re-extracted twice with 3 ml of acetone for 10 min under same conditions. Three supernatants were combined and made up to a final volume of 10 ml with acetone. About 1.5 ml of extracts was filtrated by a 0.2-μm organic film and kept at 4 °C prior to HPLC analysis. All procedures were performed under dim light condition and at room temperature. 2.3 HPLC analysis The HPLC analysis was conducted according to the protocol of Gilmore and Yamamoto (1991) with modifications. Ten microlitres of extracts were analyzed in a Shimadzu HPLC system (LC-10AT pump, CTO-10A column oven, SCL-10A vp system controller, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a UV-VIS detector (SPD-10A) set at 440 nm and a spherisorb C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Waters, USA). The mobile phase A was acetonitrile:methanol:0.05 mol/l Tris–HCl (72:8:3) and B was methanol:hexane (5:1). The elution procedure is as follows: 100% A for first 4 min, then in a linear gradient from 0% to 100% B in 2.5 min and constant 100% B for 13.5 min, then equilibrated with 100% A for 5 min prior to the injection of next sample. The flow rate was 1.5 ml min −1 at room temperature. HPLC grade of standards of lutein (Sigma–Aldrich, USA) and β-carotene (Sigma–Aldrich, USA) were utilized for the quality and quantity analysis. 2.4 NIRS analysis A total of 151 samples were scanned on a NIR Systems model 5000 monochromator (NIR Systems Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA). About 0.5 g freeze-dried powder was loaded in a small ring cup with 20 mm i.d., and reflectance spectra (log 1/ R ) from 1100 to 2500 nm were recorded at 2 nm intervals. Each sample was subsequently scanned three times and the average spectrum was collected. 2.5 Calibration and validation procedures WINISI (version 1.04) software (Infrasoft International, Port Matila, PA, USA) was used to collect spectra, develop equations and evaluate calibration performance. Principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS) and modified PLS (MPLS) were used to analyze the regression effect. Different math treatments were applied during equation development in MPLS, e.g. 2,4,4,1, where the first number indicates the order of the derivative (0 represents no derivative, 1 represents the first derivative and 2 represents the second derivative of log 1/ R ), the second is the gap in data points over which the derivative is calculated, the third and fourth numbers refer to the number of data points used in the first and second smoothing, respectively. The most significant wave regions for NIRS estimation of lutein and β-carotene were studied by calculating the correlation coefficients between the carotenoids values and the spectral data (second derivative, scatter corrected). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Lutein and β-carotene composition in the calibration set The composition of lutein and β-carotene in non-seed tissues of 151 Chinese kale samples are listed in Table 1 . The calibration set with 122 samples was randomly selected from original set and the rest 29 samples were grouped as external validation set. The ranges of lutein and β-carotene were from 0.044 to 2.223 mg g −1 DW and 0.006 to 4.852 mg g −1 DW, respectively. Wide variations were observed for lutein and β-carotene among samples, which was mainly due to the incorporation of samples from different varieties, organs, and growth conditions. Obviously, due to the limitation of sample number and the relative diversity of carotenoid content, one or two obviously blank distributions of both lutein and β-carotene in the sample set were observed ( Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, there are remarkable bimodal natures of lutein distribution at range of 0.04–0.3 mg g −1 DW and of 0.3–1.7 mg g −1 DW in sample set. For β-carotene, the bimodal nature of distribution occurred at range of 0.01–0.6 mg g −1 DW and 1.0–3.0 mg g −1 DW, respectively. The first peak is primarily related with the distribution of different plant parts of Chinese kale, and the second peak is mainly originated from the different varieties. Both of the blank and bimodal nature indicated that more different sample should be continuously research collected in the future experiments. 3.2 NIR spectra analysis NIR spectra for all samples in calibration set were shown in Fig. 3 and the results showed that a considerable contribution was due to diversity among samples in a wide wavelength range (1700–2400 nm), a typical near-infrared range. Indeed, this range had been used to measure maize pigments by NIRS method ( Brenna and Berardo, 2004 ). Although NIRS procedure was inherently empirical, its underlying analytical basis could be explored by identifying the spectral regions associated with the analyzed trait ( Roberts et al., 1997 ). According to the correlation of structural characteristics and NIR spectra ( Cen and He, 2007 ), it should be quite similar for NIR spectra between lutein and β-carotene in theory. However, some differences were also revealed in the wavelength range of 1452–2382 nm ( Fig. 4 ). The highest correlated wavelengths (absolute value of higher than 0.9) were 2176, 2336, 1770 and 2066 nm for lutein and 2176, 2336 and 1770 nm for β-carotene, respectively. Most of them belong to the range of spectral regions associated to lutein (1158–2378 nm) found by Brenna and Berardo (2004) in the analysis of maize seeds. Therefore, the major contribution for developing the calibration model for lutein and β-carotene was the whole NIR spectral range. The most significant wavelength for lutein content was 2176 nm, which does not confirm the previous result of Brenna and Berardo (2004) , who found 1168 nm as the most relevant wavelength for lutein determination in maize seed. 3.3 NIR calibration model As shown in Table 2 , low SEC and high RSQ in calibration set for lutein were obtained both in PLS and MPLS regressions when compared with PCR regression. In cross-validation set, higher S.D. of the reference data to SECV ratio (S.D./SECV) of 4.854 and 4.728 and 1 − VR (1 minus variance ratio) of 0.958 and 0.955 were also obtained in these two regressions, respectively. For β-carotene, same phenomena emerged and low SEC (0.126 and 0.131 mg g −1 DW) and high RSQ (0.982), S.D./SECV (5.471 and 5.430) and 1 − VR (0.967 and 0.966) were obtained in PLS and MPLS regressions. There were some differences in NIR calibration model for both lutein and β-carotene between MPLS and PLS regression; however, the use of principal component regression gave less accurate results than those obtained from MPLS and PLS regression. The equations in PLS and MPLS regression for lutein and β-carotene showed high RSQ values, and low standard errors in calibration and cross-validation. It implied that a reliable estimation of lutein and β-carotene could be obtained by NIRS with both PLS and MPLS regressions. Moreover, considering the algorithm of MPLS, this method was selected to employ the subsequent tests. The good relationships of NIRS predicted versus HPLC data for lutein and β-carotene were shown in Fig. 5 in calibration set under MPLS. A group of samples covering a wider range for NIRS calibration could probably result in much more accurate calibration equations ( Velasco and Becker, 1998 ). In the present study, the calibration set included samples collected from different organs and varieties which were cultivated in greenhouse or field at different locations and cultured with different fertilizers during different years. The good results obtained in the calibration set for both lutein and β-carotene could be explained by this large variability among analyzed samples. 3.4 Math treatment in MPLS The results in Table 3 show that the second derivative of the spectra (2,4,4,1) in lutein could give the better results than those obtained from another second derivative (2,8,8,1). The lowest SEC (0.131 mg g −1 DW) and highest RSQ (0.982) of lutein were obtained by transforming the raw optical data into the second derivative (2,4,4,1) prior to calibration. Furthermore, the highest S.D./SECV of 4.728 and 1 − VR of 0.955 were also obtained in 2,4,4,1. Like the calibration for lutein, the second derivative method (2,4,4,1) could also be selected to develop the calibration equation for β-carotene. For the NIRS analysis of lutein and β-carotene, high RSQ of 0.97 and 0.82 for lutein and β-carotene in maize seeds had been reported by Brenna and Berardo (2004) in MPLS with 2,8,6. However, significant improved results of higher values of RSQ for lutein (0.983) and β-carotene (0.982) in MPLS with 2,4,4,1 were obtained in present experiment. 3.5 External validation statistics in MPLS The external validation statistics for lutein and β-carotene are shown in Table 4 . Significant correlation of the plotting reference values versus predicted values could be found with high RSQ of 0.926 and 0.875 for lutein and β-carotene, respectively, confirmed also by the ratio of the standard deviation to SEP (RPD) of 3.641 and 2.787, the bias values of −0.009 and 0.014 and a slope of 0.985 and 0.964 for lutein and β-carotene, respectively. 4 Conclusions Against the results of HPLC, the regression of MPLS with math treatment (2,4,4,1) showed an excellent estimation ability on the quantitative analysis of lutein and β-carotene in Chinese kale. For the first time, NIRS analysis has demonstrated that it can be used to estimate the composition of lutein and β-carotene in freeze-dried samples. The NIRS equations of lutein and β-carotene developed in the present work represent only a first step, and they should be tested, expanded, and improved in future by adding other special samples of Chinese kale and other vegetables.

       "  'abstract': 'HPLC and Real-time PCR experiments were conducted for investigating the dynamics of GA3,IAA and ABA in response to Rice dwarf virus (RDV) infection on rice variety Yixiang 2292 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica cv. Yixiang 2292). The results showed that GA3 content was significantly lower in RDV infected rice than that in healthy plants,being 6.28 and 5.92 times lower at 1 and 10 days after symptom appearance,respectively. The content of IAA in RDV infected rice plants was fluctuated,but always lower than that in healthy one. The lowest point was at 10th day after symptom appearance,which was 3.58 times lower than that in healthy plants. In contrast to GA3 and IAA,the level of ABA in infected rice plants was always higher,the most significant increase was at 1 and 13 days after symptom appearance,2.29 and 2.84 times more in the diseased plants than in control. Real-time PCR experiments were conducted to investigate expression change of hormone regulated genes. The results showed that oxidoreductase,a GA3 related gene decreased after RDV infection. Cullin-1 and P-glycoprotein 1 genes involved in the metabolism of IAA and ABA,were up-regulated to various extents. All these indicated that the symptom induced by RDV infection might be the result of phytohormones disruption.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Integrated approach and bioresource engineering are often required to deal with multiple and interactive environmental problems for sustainable development at local and regional scales. Pig farming has flourished with fast growing economy and increasing human demands for meat in China. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), a noxious invasive species, has encroached into most of the local rivers and lakes. Both the wastes from the booming pig farms as well as the massive plant materials of water hyacinth have caused a range of serious ecological and environmental problems. Here we present an integrated sustainable, ecological and experimental study that was designed to deal with these two problems simultaneously. Our experimental results showed that the mixtures of water hyacinth with pig manure consistently had much higher biogas production than pig manure alone, and that the highest biogas production was achieved when 15% of the fermentation substrates were water hyacinth. Our analysis further revealed that the changing C/N ratio and the lignin content in the fermentation feedstock due to the addition of water hyacinth might be two important factors affecting the biogas production. We also found that the solar-powered water-heating unit significantly increased the biogas production (especially in winter time). Overall, the project proved to be successful ecologically and socially. Through such an integrated approach and bioresource engineering, wastes are treated, energy is harvested, and the environment is protected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The X protein (HBx) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) promotes the growth of liver cancer cells through altering S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis. Thus, we speculated that a link between HBx and MAT2A may contribute to HCC development. In this study, the effects of HBx on MAT2A expression and cell apoptosis were investigated, and the molecular mechanism by which HBx and MAT2A regulate tumorigenesis was evaluated. Results from immunohistochemistry analyses of 37 pairs of HBV-associated liver cancer tissues/corresponding peritumor tissues showed that HBx and MAT2A are highly expressed in most liver tumor tissues. Our in vitro results revealed that HBx activates MAT2A expression in a dose-dependent manner in hepatoma cells, and such regulation requires the cis-regulatory elements NF-κB and CREB on the MAT2A gene promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) further demonstrated that HBx facilitates the binding of NF-κB and CREB to MAT2A gene promoter. In addition, overexpression of HBx or MAT2A inhibits cell apoptosis, whereas knockdown of MAT2A expression stimulates apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HBx reduces MAT1A expression and AdoMet production but enhances MAT2β expression. Thus, we proposed that HBx activates MAT2A expression through NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways to reduce AdoMet production, inhibit hepatoma cell apoptosis, and perhaps enhance HCC development. These findings should provide new insights into our understanding how the molecular mechanisms underline the effects of HBV infection on the production of MAT2A and the development of HCC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was the only approved and available vaccine during the 2016-2018 influenza seasons. It did not include the B/Yamagata strain. In this study, we report an acute respiratory disease outbreak associated with influenza B/Yamagata infections in Guangzhou, Southern China (January through March, 2018). Among the 9914 patients, 2241 (22.6%) were positive for the influenza B virus, with only 312 (3.1%) positive for the influenza A virus. The influenza B/Yamagata lineage dominated during this period in Southern China. The highest incidence of influenza A virus infection occurred in the children aged 5-14 years. In contrast, populations across all age groups were susceptible to the influenza B virus. Phylogenetic, mutations, and 3D structure analyses of hemagglutinin (HA) genes were performed to assess the vaccine-virus relatedness. The recommended A/H1N1 vaccine strain (A/Michigan/45/2015) during both 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 was antigen-specific for these circulating isolates (clade 6B.1) in Spring 2018. An outbreak of influenza B/Yamagata (clade 3) infections in 2018 occurred during the absence of the corresponding vaccine during 2016-2018. The recommended influenza B/Yamagata vaccine strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013) for the following season (2018-2019) was antigen-specific. Although there were only a few influenza B/Victoria infections in Spring 2018, five amino acid mutations were identified in the HA antigenic sites of the 19 B/Victoria isolates (clade 1A), when compared with the 2016-2018 B/Victoria vaccine strain. The number was larger than expected and suggested that the influenza B HA gene may be more variable than previously thought. One of the mutations (K180N) was noted to likely alter the epitope and to potentially affect the viral antigenicity. Seven mutations were also identified in the HA antigenic sites of 2018-2020 B/Victoria vaccine strain, of which some or all may reduce immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of the vaccine, perhaps leading to more outbreaks in subsequent seasons. The combined epidemiological, phylogenetic, mutations, and 3D structural analyses of the HA genes of influenza strains reported here contribute to the understanding and evaluation of how HA mutations affect vaccine efficacy, as well as to providing important data for screening and selecting more specific, appropriate, and effective influenza vaccine candidate strains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dynamic genetic effects on threonine content (TC) of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) meal were analysed at 5 developmental times/stages using the genetic models for diploid plant seeds. Results indicated that the expression of diploid embryo, cytoplasmic and diploid maternal plant genes were all important for the performance of TC at various developmental times/stages of rapeseed, especially at the early and middle developmental stages. Among different genetic systems, TC was mainly controlled by the cumulative or net maternal main effects and the genotype × environment (GE) interaction effects, followed by the embryo main effects and GE interaction effects. The expression of genes was more easily influenced by the environmental factors at the first three developmental stages. The total narrow-sense heritabilities for TC on 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43 days post anthesis were 46.50, 62.60, 57.10, 84.70 and 59.50%, respectively, of which the interaction heritabilities were more important at the first three developmental stages of rapeseed. The improvement in TC of rapeseed meal could be expected by selection based on the higher narrow-sense heritabilities near maturity. The predicted genetic effects of parents showed that TC of progeny could be improved by using the parent Gaoyou 605.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'China has experienced unprecedented urbanization since the 1980s, resulting in substantial climatic effects from local cities to broad regions. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model dynamically coupled to an urban canopy model, we quantified the summertime climate effects of urban expansion in Chinau0027s most rapidly urbanizing regions: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD). High-resolution landscape data of each urban agglomeration for 1988, 2000, and 2010 were used for simulations. Our results indicated summertime urban warming of 0.85\\u2009°C for BTH, 0.78\\u2009°C for YRD, and 0.57\\u2009°C for PRD, which was substantially greater than previous estimates. Peak summer warming for BTH, YRD, and PRD was 1.5°C, 1\\u2009°C, and 0.8\\u2009°C, respectively. In contrast, the loss of moisture was greatest in PRD, with maximum reduction in 2-m water vapor mixing ratio close to 1\\u2009g/kg, followed by YRD and BTH with local peak humidity deficits reaching 0.8\\u2009g/kg and 0.6\\u2009g/kg, respectively. Our results were in better agreement with observations than prior studies because of the usage of high-resolution landscape data and the inclusion of key land-atmospheric interactions. Our study also demonstrated that the warming impacts of polycentric urban forms were less intense but more extensive in space, whereas large concentrated urban aggregations produced much stronger but localized warming effects. These findings provide critical knowledge that improves our understanding of urban-atmospheric interactions, with important implications for urban landscape management and planning to alleviate the negative impacts of urban heat islands.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ampelopsis sinica root is widely used in Chinese folk medicine for treating liver disorders caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The present study was performed in order to investigate the anti-HBV activity and mechanisms of the ethanol extract from A. sinica root (EASR) in vitro. The antiviral activity of EASR was examined by detecting the levels of HBsAg, HBeAg and extracellular HBV DNAs in stable HBV-producing human hepatoblastoma HepG2 2.2.15 cells. We found that EASR effectively suppressed the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg from HepG2 2.2.15 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and it also suppressed the amount of extracellular HBV DNA. After EASR treatment, the percentage of apoptotic cells was found to be significantly higher than that of control by flow cytometric analysis. A luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the effects of EASR on the activities of HBV promoters and intracellular signaling pathways. The results showed that EASR selectively inhibited the activities of HBV promoters (Cp, S1p and Fp) and the p53 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells significantly. These data indicate that EASR exerts anti-HBV effects via inhibition of HBV promoters and the p53-associated signaling pathway, which helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying the potential therapeutic value of EASR. © 2011 Ran Pang et al.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Superfine grinding technology was applied for polysaccharide extraction from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum, and response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the effects of processing parameters on polysaccharide extraction yield. Results showed that the maximum yield of G. lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) was obtained at an optimum condition: extraction time 137 min, extraction temperature 66 ̊C, the ratio of water to material 35 mL/g, and the GLP extracting yield reached 2.44% under this condition. GLP were precipitated into three crude polysaccharides, viz. GLP40, GLP60 and GLP80. The basic characterization of polysaccharides was determined by using HPLC and FT-IR methods. GLP, GLP80, GLP60, and GLP40 were composed of Man, Rib, Glc, Gal and Fuc with the molar ratios of 1.27:0.36:22.89:1.61:0.33, 1.40:0.31:23.02:3.46:0.91, 0.96:0.34:25.76:2.47:0.46, and 2.81:1.42:23.83:1.61:0.33, respectively. The result of FT-IR suggested that the monosaccharide residue of the four polysaccharides was β-pyranoid ring. Moreover, the antioxidant activities of these four polysaccharides were evaluated. The results showed that GLP80 had the best reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging ability and oxygen radical scavenging ability followed by GLP, GLP60 and GLP40. Our results demonstrated that RSM might be a valuable technique for optimizing the efficient extraction of GLP, and G. lucidum could be considered as sources of natural antioxidants and preservatives of food industry. Moreover, polysaccharides, especially GLP80, extracted from the fruiting bodies of G. lucidum, exhibited promising antioxidant activities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases, cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKCε/JNK/c-Jun and PKCα/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-α signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The drylands in northern China are expected to face dramatic land system change in the context of socioeconomic development and environmental conservation. Recent studies have addressed changes of land cover with socioeconomic development in the drylands in northern China. However, the changes in land use intensity and the potential role of environmental conservation measures have yet to be adequately examined. Given the importance of land management intensity to the ecological conditions and regional sustainability, our study projected land system change in Hohhot city in the drylands in northern China from 2013 to 2030. Here, land systems are defined as combinations of land cover and land use intensity. Using the CLUMondo model, we simulated land system change in Hohhot under three scenarios: a scenario following historical trends, a scenario with strong socioeconomic and land use planning, and a scenario focused on achieving environmental conservation targets. Our results showed that Hohhot is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all three scenarios. The agricultural intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend scenario compared to those with more planning interventions. The dynamics of grasslands depend strongly on projections of livestock and other claims on land resources. In the historical trend scenario, intensively grazed grasslands increase whereas a large amount of the current area of grasslands with livestock converts to forest under the scenario with strong planning. Strong conversion from grasslands with livestock and extensive cropland to semi-natural grasslands was estimated under the conservation scenario. The findings provide an input into discussions about environmental management, planning and sustainable land system design for Hohhot.',\n",

Eight parents were included in adiallel mating design in two environments. It was found that the embryo, cytoplasmic and maternal main effects and their GE interaction effects could simultaneously affect the performance of EAC, especially for the cytoplasmic and maternal effects. Since the amount of genetic main effects from the expression of genes in different genetic systems accounted for about 64.1%of the total genetic effects, EAC of rapeseed was mainly controlled by genetic main effects. The total narrow-sense heritability for EAC was 83.6% with the general heritability being 51.9% and the interaction heritability being 31.7%.

       "  'abstract': 'The Grain to Green (GTG) program launched in 1999 by the Chinese government is one of the largest ecological restoration programs ever implemented in the world. Although the GTG program has been demonstrated to affect ecosystem services in the revegetated areas, its impacts on regional climate are seldom reported and poorly understood. Therefore, our study examined the impacts of revegetation owing to the GTG program on summer climate in the Loess Plateau, by incorporating near real-time remotely sensed land use/land cover data and vegetation characteristics of 2001 and 2010 into a coupled land-atmosphere model. From 2001 to 2010, a considerable portion of croplands was converted to forests and grasslands, with vegetation fraction and LAI increasing while surface albedo decreasing throughout the Loess Plateau. Compared with those from 2001, simulation results from 2010 indicated lowered 2-m air temperature in summer, with the magnitude of reduction in nighttime minimum (as high as 0.8-1.0 degrees C) greater than that in daytime maximum (generally restricted to 0.4 degrees C). The concurrent decrease in summertime 2-m specific humidity further led to widespread reduction of near-surface heat content (i.e., moist enthalpy). Summer precipitation decreased in northern Shanxi province and western Loess Plateau (up to 1.0-1.4 mm/day) while increasing in southeastern Loess Plateau (between 1.0-2.0 mm/day). Our findings underscore that vegetation restoration has exerted strong influences on regional climate, and provide useful information for the sustainable implementation of the GTG program.',\n",

In order to analyze the response trend of seed germination of desert plants to changes in temperature and soil moisture,three typical desert plants Mongolian Calligonum(Calligonum mongolica),Nitraria Sphaerocarpa(Nitraria sphaerocarpa) and Ma Huang(Ephedra przewalskii) were chosen,and their seed germinations in different air temperature((16 ℃) /(22 ℃) and(21 ℃) /(27 ℃)), soil moistures(3%, 5% and 15%),soaking(12 h) and without soaking in artificial climatic chambers were investigated.The results showed that,for Mongolian Calligonum and Nitraria Sphaerocarpa,the seed germination percentages increased with increasing soil moisture;and,with increasing air temperature,the seed germination percentage increased more for soaked seeds than for unsoaked seeds.For Ma Huang,with increasing air temperature,the seed germination percentage increased more for unsoaked seeds than for soaked seeds;and,the increase of seed germination percentage with increasing air temperature for soaked seeds under 3% soil moisture was higher than that under 5% or 15% soil moisture((P<)0.05).The index of seed germination for Mongolian Calligonum,Nitraria Sphaerocarpa and Ma Huang increased with increasing soil moisture or air temperature.For Mongolian Calligonum and Nitraria Sphaerocarpa,the increase of seed germination index with increasing air temperature for unsoaked seeds was higher than for soaked seeds.For Ma Huang,the increased of seed germination index with increasing air temperature for soaked seeds was higher than for unsoaked seeds.The seed germination rates for the three plants increased quickly during the early and middle incubation periods.The seed germination of these desert plants was influenced by the air temperature and soil moisture together,and the responses of different plant seed germinations to changes in these factors were different.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Grasslands provide a variety of ecosystem services (ESs) for humans. While much ES research has focused on forests and wetlands, synthesizing the currently somewhat sporadic studies of grassland ecosystem services (GESs) is much needed. We aimed to review the scope, major methods, and key findings of GESs, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions. We conducted a systematic review of articles published during 1970–2018 (including 380 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science and 32 book chapters from Google Scholar). The number of GES studies has accelerated in recent decades, with China (31%) and the United States (18%) together accounting for almost half of them. A total of 33 GESs were mentioned in the searched articles, of which carbon sequestration, forage production, and water erosion control had the highest frequencies. Methods for evaluating GESs include field survey, field experiments, and statistical and process-based modeling. Grasslands are the primary source of meat and dairy products, account for about one-third of the total carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, and provide numerous other ESs, such as night cooling, soil erosion control, and flood mitigation. This review presents the state-of-the-science of GESs, and identifies several future research directions. To move forward, we propose a framework with a 3-M methodology: (1) “Multi-scales”—understanding GESs from various spatiotemporal scales; (2) “Multi-methods”—evaluating GESs with multiple statistical and modeling techniques using multiple data sources; and (3) “Multi-perspectives”—assessing GESs from ecological, social, and economic perspectives for sustainability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Urban impervious surfaces (UIS) are well known to have negative impacts on the environment. Studies that consider multiple UIS-influencing factors at multiple administrative levels and spatial scales are still lacking. The main goal of this study was to determine the major socioeconomic factors that shaped the spatiotemporal patterns of UIS in China from the county to provincial levels over the most recent decades. Specifically, remote sensing and statistical data from 1992 to 2009 were used to examine the relationship of UIS to a suite of socioeconomic factors across hierarchical administrative levels from small (county), medium (prefectural) to large (provincial) levels. Our results show that the key influencing factors of UIS varied substantially across hierarchical administrative levels: economic factors dominated the provincial level, demographic factors were most significant at the county level, and a mixed group of economic, demographic and traffic factors were important at the prefectural level. This suggests that, for determining major influencing factors for UIS, a hierarchical or multiscale approach is preferred to any single-scale analysis. Our findings from such a hierarchical perspective provide useful information for formulating mitigation strategies for excessive UIS expansions and for designing more sustainable cities. It is recommended that policies to control rampant expansion of UIS in China need to combine macro-scale economic regulations with micro-scale demographic planning measures.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'External guide sequences (EGSs) are RNA molecules that consist of a sequence complementary to a target mRNA and recruit intracellular ribonuclease P (RNase P), a tRNA processing enzyme, for specific degradation of the target mRNA. We have previously used an in vitro selection procedure to generate EGS variants that efficiently induce human RNase P to cleave a target mRNA in vitro. In this study, we constructed EGSs from a variant to target the overlapping region of the S mRNA, pre-S/L mRNA, and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which are essential for viral replication and infection. The EGS variant was about 50-fold more efficient in inducing human RNase P to cleave the mRNA in vitro than the EGS derived from a natural tRNA. Following Salmonella-mediated gene delivery, the EGSs were expressed in cultured HBV-carrying cells. A reduction of about 97% and 75% in the level of HBV RNAs and proteins and an inhibition of about 6,000- and 130-fold in the levels of capsid-associated HBV DNA were observed in cells treated with Salmonella vectors carrying the expression cassette for the variant and the tRNA-derived EGS, respectively. Our study provides direct evidence that the EGS variant is more effective in blocking HBV gene expression and DNA replication than the tRNA-derived EGS. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the feasibility of developing Salmonella-mediated gene delivery of highly active EGS RNA variants as a novel approach for gene-targeting applications such as anti-HBV therapy.',\n",
